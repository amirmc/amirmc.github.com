TEsting. About a month ago I was at TEDx Granta. The theme was Alive & Kicking and it was a good event with some really interesting speakers, including:

- Eben Upton, on the Raspberry Pi Foundation (pic 2)
- Merlin Crossingham, on Wallace & Gromit (pics 5&6)
- Tim Minshall, on how engineers make the future (pic 9)

Videos will be on the website at some point for those who want to catchup.
