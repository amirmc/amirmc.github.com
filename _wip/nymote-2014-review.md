It's been a while since the last update and a lot of interesting things happened throughout 2014. There are two large trends, which include the ongoing spate of security issues and the increasing evidence of a strong desire for a *decentralised* Internet of Things.





## Where to next?

These two trends point to the needs for new technological approaches in order to create more secure and safer systems. This necessarily means revisiting the old assumptions and evaluating them afresh. The products and services also need to work in a decentralised manner by default so that users can gain more agency over the way their data is used. 

In the next post, I'll cover the progress we've made with the tools underlying Nymote over the last year and how we're beginning to put the pieces together for a prototype deployment.


<!-- All of these point to the need to build new systems using . The assumptions we've made so about developing for the web have repeatedly turned out to be flawed. Systems not designed to be connected do end up networked and compounded exploits are how systems are broken.  -->
