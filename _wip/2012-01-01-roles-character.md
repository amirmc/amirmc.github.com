# Difference between Roles and Character

http://tamarapaton.blogspot.com/2007/09/authenticity-at-work-notion-of.html


Ok, I think I get it now. It’s about being yourself while still playing the role that others expect of you.

Yes, I agree that can be very difficult if your natural tendencies are the polar opposite of those you have to work with. I can also imagine that it gets very tiring playing a role you don’t feel comfortable in. Especially if you feel ‘out of character’.

I don’t know if this will help but I did drama at school (read: high-school for US readers) and one of the first things we discussed was the difference between role and character. We each have our own character which is the basis of who we really are. However, we play a multitude of different roles in any given day. The most obvious examples were the roles we play in front of our parents and those in front of friends. There are even roles we play in different social circles, which can become (sometimes embarrassingly) evident when two circles unexpectedly connect. Same character, different role.

I guess the point I’m trying to make is that when you deal with 60+yr old board members you should try and remember that you’re not really out of character (and therefore false). You’re just playing an appropriate role, which they (implicitly) expect of you. Maybe that’s easier said than done, though. Out of interest, how do you think you will feel when you’re 60+ and some young thing is being irreverent?

Garron, that’s a really interesting case. Personally, I think I’d prefer your style of management so I wouldn’t know what to say. I think it comes down to picking up on peoples preferences and trying to behave accordingly but I’ve limited experience of that. The only suggestion I could make would be having a go at amateur dramatics. That might sound a little odd but I have to say that doing drama at school was one of the best decisions I ever made. It essentially gave me the ability and confidence to play different roles/characters. Let me know if you decide to go that way, though it might not be so easy in Rwanda... :)

On roles

This difference between roles and character has a direct bearing on our life online. Specifically, as more and more peole join networks and those networks grow, how do we mai tain relationships?
take the example of FB TIMELINE. When I first started posting, it was undertge premise that things wererelatively pri ate and only a certaingroups of ppl souls see them. As my fb crowd has grown. So have the types of Interactions I have and the groups of people I havethem with.  The only way of deali g with this is if I ONLY use each type of network for limited thing in other words, artificial limiting my social groups. The big bloggers have to this for obvious reasons (no one follows them to heat about breakfat) but that indicates it's no really a SOCIAL tool for them. It's essentially work. I don't Wang go have to dothat.  Bir do I wan to artificially draw lines among groups of friends. While that's easy irl it's rather cold and difficult and time consuming online. Also I'd lose the ability to discover interesting things about friends.
