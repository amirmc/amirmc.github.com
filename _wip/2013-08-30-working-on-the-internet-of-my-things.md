For a long time I've been interested what the future holds in terms of how we will interact with each other and our environments.  Back in the day, these areas used to be called ubiquitous computing and home automation but have since been subsumed by the (only slightly) catchier moniker of Internet of Things (IoT).

A couple of my ideas involved controlling devices at home via SMS messages (this was way before smart phones and 'apps' came along).  For example, being able to set my VCR to record a show while I'm out\* or pre-heat the oven when I'm heading home with a frozen pizza<sup>&dagger;</sup>.  Of course, if I were to implement these now I'd take a completely different approach.  With all the advances we've made, the Internet of Things has huge potential to change our lives the way the Internet itself did.

However, if we take the last decade of the Internet and Web as an example of how the IoT may play out it's actually not a pretty picture.  We're in the age of the Internet behemoths, with huge centralised data silos containing lots of our personal data.  Sure there is some choice among providers but it's fast becoming a case of "choose your dictator".  Our information is trapped, interoperating is becoming convoluted and to top it off, these giants are busy fighting legal battles with each other instead of out-competing.  Users just get caught in the cross-fire.

If we extrapolate this to the Internet of Things then, ultimately, it'll become a winner-take-all-my-data arrangement.  Remember, we're talking about connecting more devices to the Internet and giving almost ubiquitous access to our daily lives and habits.  Trading more of my personal life, from within my home, with increasingly faceless companies and for not very much in return, isn't particularly appealing.

If the IoT plays out this way, the we will effectively *increase* the Privacy Tax that we've *already* had to pay for our social networking tools.  In order to benefit from the world of connected devices, we have to adjust (again) the notion of ownership.  I want this to be the Internet of **my** Things, so how do we make that happen?

To really achieve that, we need to have software infrastructure that incorporates [Privacy by Design][], so that an individual can regain the ability to control their data and decide for themselves whom to share it with.  These infrastructure tools must also work in a distributed fashion, so there's no requirement to ally yourself to any particular centralised service. Of course, the tools themselves also have to be open-source, so that developers can be reassured that the ground they're building their products on won't be taken away from them.

In the last year and a half, I've been exploring these ideas at the [Cambridge Computer Laboratory][].  A lot of cutting edge work is being done on the problems of Identity, connectivity and the operating systems for the future.  There's a larger picture emerging from this work and it's time to start talking more about it and describing the pieces.  We're calling this collection of OSS tools **[Nymote][]** and there's a new site where you can read more about it and keep up with news and releases.  

I'll be writing more about this work both here and on the [Nymote Blog][].  I'd love to hear from others who are interested in this area so please do [get in touch][] with me or leave a comment.
