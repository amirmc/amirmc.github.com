From the infographic below.

- "Odds of dying while skydiving in the US: 1 in 101,083 jumps"
- "Dance parties: 1 in 100,000 chance of dying"

Wonder what the [BCPA][] would make of this, since they recklessly combine both Skydiving *and* parties on a regular basis (how extreme).

Seriously though, this nicely depicts that many things have *worse* odds than skydiving.  However, base jumping (which is not the same thing as skydiving) seems to be the most dangerous by far (1 in 60).
