Airtime launched yesterday, which is Sean Parker's new startup.  Apparently the launch didn't go so well (the demo didn't actually work) but I've just seen the video and I'm keen to see where this goes.  Personally, I wont be using it but only because I'd have to use it with Facebook.  Of course, that's part of the selling point of the product but I simply don't use Facebook Connect and I try and limit what I do on FB anyway.

The naysayers already seem to be out in force with claims like "why do we need this?".  I think they're completely missing the point.  The explosion of Chatroulette should have indicated that people are missing some randomness in their lives.  Sure, it degenerated into a bunch of penises but the fact that it grew at all says something about the people who were using it.  Random connections can be fun.

Sean Parker's said "There's no serendipity," Parker said. "Everything now is filtered through the social graph. We have the ability to share media faster than ever before. But the social network is somewhat constraining. It is become an increasingly public forum. You're doing everything in front of your friends and that's limiting." [cnet][]

This is very true. Other than dating sites, there's little online in the way of connecting to new people.  Old methods of doing so would be web forums, small communities around interests like knitting, singing etc etc. But of course thos invariably fill up with the 'serious' knitters or singers.  you can't casually say "I kinda like knitting but I'm not gonna devote a huge amount of effort to contribute to this forum".

Meeting people online isn't easy and services that can do that are likely to be interesting to a lot of people (beyond simply dating).  This is clearly a gap that Airtime/FB can fill.

That's why it's interesting.  It's a shame that it doesn't work as a stand-alone product but maybe that will happen in time (or maybe it'll be so integrated with FB that they'd never do that).  Time will tell.  

I find it very interesting.
