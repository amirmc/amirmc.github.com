About a month ago I was at [TEDx Granta][].  The theme was Alive & Kicking and it was a good event with some really interesting speakers, including:

- Eben Upton, Co-founder of The Raspberry Pi Foundation (pic 2)
- Merlin Crossingham, Creative Director of Wallace & Gromit (pics 5&6)
- Tim Minshall, Senior Lecturer, IfM, Cambridge University (pic 9)

Videos will be on the website at some point for those who want to catchup.  

There's also another TED event taking place in June. [TEDx Oxbridge][], organised by students from Oxford and Cambridge, will be on the theme of Unconventional Wisdom.  Not sure who the speakers are yet.
