Essentiallty this boils down to, are people asking for you service or do you have to find creative ways to reframe your solution/problem.

examples: motor car quote (faster horse)

dropbox, nobody searches for 'how do i store files online'.  In fact, look at some old quotes where peopel didn;t even see a need for the service!

If you have a dropbox problem, then you'll have to get creative.  Airtime may have faced this if they'd tried to do customer dev.  Sometime you  really do have to follow a vision and let people try something.  especially when it's so new they can't otherwise understand it.

vis FB, twitter, Airtime, dropbox etc
