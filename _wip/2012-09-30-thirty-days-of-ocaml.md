I've set myself a challenge that over the next thirty days, I'll teach myself [OCaml][].  This won't be easy since it'll be my first experience of functional programming as well as a new language. 

As I go along, I'll try and write one post a day describing my experiences (and likely my frustrations) as well as the questions that occur to me.  Some of those posts might be ridiculously basic (like how to install things) and others might show my naivete (as I run down blind alleys). Either way, keeping a diary will be useful for me and maybe also for other folks who've considered trying out FP and OCaml in particular.

Obviously, I'm not completely new to programming but I'm certainly not as 'technical' as the folks I tend to hang out with. Just to give you a better picture, my coding experience so far has involved:

- Some [C][]/[C++][] with a little [OOP][] programming for a High Energy Physics simulation (during my undergrad - a loooong time ago so I've forgotten everything)
- A bunch of [Matlab][] and [Bash][] scripting for analysis of neuroimaging data (during my PhD)
- A bunch of [VBA][] within MS Excel for analysing behavioural data (also during my PhD -- I wish someone had pointed me to Python back then)
- Part of [Learn Python the Hard Way][] (I keep dipping in and out of this)

I tried to dump most of my old scripts, at least those I could find, into a [github repo][], but I still haven't collated the Matlab bits.

By the end of the 30 days, I'm hoping to have the ability to pick up and read other people's OCaml code and write basic stuff for myself.  I don't actually have a particular project in mind but I'm not going to let that be an excuse for *not* getting started.

I'll post again tomorrow with the mundane parts of how to get things installed and running on a Mac\*.  Onward!
