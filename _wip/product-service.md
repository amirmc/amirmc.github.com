> *"The meme maybe a cliche but it's true"*

No, it is *false* and that's why it needs to die. It prevents a wider discussion about business models and leads to (imho) ridiculously oversimplified views that are restricted to *advertising* and only *within* the product in question.  In the worst case, people may use the heuristic that paying for something somehow gives you a voice (it doesn't) or prevents a company from productizing you (it doesn't).  

For example, consider the following cases:

- Google Apps: I may be paying an annual/monthly fee for using Google's services but does that meant they will stop mining all my data and trying to show me 'relevant' ads *elsewhere* on the internet?  Just because they have a new revenue stream doesn't mean their other revenue models stop working.

- Credit cards companies: I'm probably paying fees and interest for my card but that data is still sold on to others for various purposes, including reference agencies and perhaps aggregate info on spending habits.  I've seen at least a couple of stories on HN about companies willing to sell such data.

- Tom Tom: I pay for a navigation device which also provides me with traffic data.  Data from my journey is also sent back to Tom Tom, aggregated and licensed on to external companies who may want access to it.  Note that I've already paid for a product, may be paying an additional subscription for traffic data and yet every journey I make is also a revenue generator for them.

It's only big companies that can afford to pursue multiple revenue streams this way but people are woefully naive if they think a well-resourced company *wont* explore all the ways they could increase their income.

I'll say it more succinctly: You are *both* the customer *and* the product.
