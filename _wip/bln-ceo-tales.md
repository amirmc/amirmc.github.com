Intro to Rory Cellan Jones. Who's on a diet. For comic relief. This duscussion came from rory's post after Lovefilm got sold.

Rory
Was doing last min prep on way here by rereading post. Was sad that everytime we have sucess story on UK, ppl rush for exit and invariably it's a US company that buys. 

Q for evening: should we worry if Autonomy/ARM are the last big companies in the UK

Show of hands. Fairly evenly split.

Intro to Stephen Allot.
Crown Rep for UK SME. Ppl at downing St want to care. We should but can we do anything about it?
3 qs should we have any HQs of any big companies in your country? That's where wealth iz created. However absentee landlords are frowned upon. 

I think it matter abc we bf worse

Should we care about ICT. Dunno, but it's a big step to give up on it. 

What can we do about it?  See loads of compaies emmigrating. From 600+ to 10 ppl biz. What will it rake to persuade the next Sergey Brin to come here or stay here?  I dunno.

VC Index ventures. Presumably happy to get an exit regardless

Index is one of great survivors in European scene. Will bf opening US office too. Common meme seems to be nomoney. Small exits etc. Important that we do celebrate UK tech companies etc. 
7 investments 4 in the UK. common thing is that all of those pioneer biz models, nor copied models from elsewhere. US VCs call UK stattupx to invest. 

SV is z great phenomena but can't biuld it cuz command control. 

Fantastic time to be entrepreneur. Low cost of tech (cloud) and methods of growth (Facebook et al).

I think should UK should worry. Having the HQ in thf country is a god place to be. Bugest tech firms have billions to spend on MandA.

Fletcher research and lovefilm

Cannot create global leader out of UK. Mostly an issue of scale. Example fromAmszon. Location matters eg even Facebook moved from Boston to SF.
