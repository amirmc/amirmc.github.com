**Kelsey Lynn**
*Director, Tech Ventures, Imperial Innovations*

Moved to UK after 12yrs in Palo Alto. 
Was a Mech Eng and was curious why things weren't working in the market.

II includes the tech transfer office of Imperial COllege but also does commercialisation of tech elsewhere.  II has a lot of capital to use for companies it invests in.  Listed a company on NASDAQ a while ago and in process of another for LSE.

Three requirements to get Tech from Lab to Market:

- Commercial reason: Business need
- IP + Tech ability: The company doing the commercialisation (ie. taking on a product) needs to have the ability to continue development.
- Passion/Desire: Someone has to care.

In Healthcare you can get IP etc licenses but for most others, it usu ends up being a spinout.  Kelsey's team works on spinouts.

Spinouts are of two flavours: Organic Growth or Venture Backed.
Venture is appropriate for a small proportion of spinouts.  Really needs a big market that can sustain a large company to justify the risk/reward ratio.  Disruptive tech is also attractive as it can lead to high gross margins.  For most tech you find that by the time you reach market, the cost/benefit of the tech isn;t as good as you thoguht and the market itself has moved on.

Having a financing strategy is important for the company, as is recognisong the need for multiple funding rounds.

**Stephen Allott**
*SME Crown Representative*

Talking about from science to growth. Got interested in this after floating a company on the NASDAQ. Spent a few years in the WGB in the business/university interface.  Should identify what the question is.  
Most peopl understand the resarch -> commercialisation so will look at other ways that science impacts economy

Uni does two thingss how do they make money?

Invenst stuff
1. direct spending: e.f 10% of London economy is from furhter education
2. idea-centric spending: IP/pattents well established and oft talked about
3. people centered: people will move around the world for good unis. A good uni is a people-importing mechanism. e.g Hermann Hauser who went to CAvendish for PhD.  How to encourage more people like this? Do great resarch! attarct them and then let them stay.

Look stuff up
Side benenfit of haveing more PhDs in the world means more pepel with deep knolese who know how to solve depp problems. examin work from all over the world

So what?
Should spend more money on resarch. Should attarct the entrepreneurial pppl to mix with the research.  MIT says they can detect the entrepreneural aptitude in its students. Should encourage supporters clubs. Makes money for dept, helps students get jobs, helps industry connect with resarch


**Alice Frost**
*Head of Knowledge Exchange and Skills Policy at the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)*

Role of HEFCE. Run the REF. Give unis abotu 5Bn GBP. Mainly for uni institutional infra.  Role is at HEIF - fr knowledge exchange formula

- Purpose of uni: They've always been for economic or social reasons.  It's only recentlt that resarch has grown more important (post-industrial revoloution). Also been abotu academic freeedom.  

-Policies: approach to growht and engagement an dimpact. HEIF for knowldge transfer, REF to assess impact, Consider employability as 80% of jobs are now private.

- COmmercialisation: Can go from meeting where people are all talking about commercialisation, private industry, etc and others where it's an anethema to people.  

    - challeneges: who pays for what? as public funds benefiting private enterprise. Also they're private, charities and also publically finded.


    - Opportunites: it's a natural path for some thinga from  engineering and sciences. 

Cambrdige is prob best place un uk to b doing this.


**Andy Richards**
*Serial Biotechnology Entrepreneur and Business Angel*

Principally work in areas with lots of IP , patents etc. lots of scientists. Also part of Cancer resarch uk and many other boards for resarch bodies and transfers etc. 

Some things are not most impactful via comercialisations. e.g tim Berners Lee who didn't control the WWW. However, there are many inventions etc that will never deliver benefit to scoiety without the structure and drive via a commercialisation approach.  

Most tech trasfer offies live in academia so there's as much effort on studying the process than dong stuff. :)  SO pepel tend to over-theorise or generalise to much.  Narrow examples are licensing and spinout. 

These are great story and completely wrong.  They talk of IP flows not social capital flows. In companies that succeed it's a lot mre circitious. BigCo now are doing much more around open innovations. Gain knowledge from acquisiton, 

Shortage of teams who can execute. 
no shortage of money, or research etc

social capital is the key


## Discussion

Q - New initiatives to promote social capital at level of uni/bus interaction

Andy: Great networks of people within silos. 20-somethngs within academia and the risiing stars in industry.  

Kirsty: There's clearly a marketplace problem here. Lots of smart entrepreneurs going into a market wnating to know more. and poeple leaving companies wanting to work with smart driven people.  II is setting up a platform to do this. Also a way to get info form theo exes abotu the parket pull

Andy: Cluster provides (1) Low-risk environment to take a high-risk. (2) recycling is a key. UK biotech succeeded becasue big companies shut down and peple leave and move elsewhere. becasue those people can take a risk.  Couples make much better risk-decisions than individuals. That's a v important social capital aspect. 

Stephen: five ideas (1) supervise student projects (2) supporters clubs (3) catalogued all companies formed by alumni (4) Annual dinner (5) Company awards
