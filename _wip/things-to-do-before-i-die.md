This is the current version of a list I first made when I was 12/13.  I know I have the original sheet of paper somewhere but it's in one of those really safe places which I can never remember.  This is the electronic version.


### To Do

- Learn a martial art (properly)
- Learn a musical instrument (less properly)
- Write a short story
- Finish a (half)triathlon
- Live in Japan/South Korea for a year


### Done

- Learn another language
- Live in another country for a year
- Be published (academic articles count)
- Skydive (more than once)


### Overall life goal

To achieve self-determination and financial independence.
