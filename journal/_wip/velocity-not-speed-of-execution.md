Velocity of execution (not speed) is what really matters in a startup. 

A thought occurred to me the other day 

Speed is a scalar quantity. It only has a magnitude. Other examples of scalar quantities are mass, Temperature and (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(physics)). According to the wikipedia article a scalar quantity does not change  after transformations of the coordinate system. 

A vector has both magnitude and direction. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(physics). Examples of vectors are  forces (eg gravity). Vector quantities do change when the coordinate system changes. 

So why does this matter to execution (eg in Startups?)
One of the main benefits  is the ability to execute quickly. In fact some ppl have suggested that this is the main competitive advantage of a Startups when compared with bigco.  

The concept of direction is implicit when talking about building a product or entering the market. There's usually some kind of destination in mind that the founders have in mind, even if it's only vaguely articulated (eg the Heroku of apps). However, it doesn't get referred to very often when in the trenches. Each act or decision or line of code should help you get closer to that goal and ther will be plenty of decisions you need to turn down to get there. Executing in the right direction is paramount. Tis is even more important when you consider the concept of pivoting. A pivot, by definition, is when you change direction. Therefore you're now executing in a different direction. 
 Talking about speed of execution doesn't really capture this very well. After thinking about it this way, I'm far more inclined to think about how each step/decision gets you closer to your goal as well as how quickly it's going to get you therre. 

Hence, velocity of execution is what matters, not speed. 

I'd be curious to know what others think. 

a related thought. A few months ago I was talking to a founder about what it takes to. Build a business. He was adamant that the most important thing is that you want to build a biz. I disagreed, since I felt that you have to have some vision/desire in order to really make it. 

I saw this as two parts of the same thing.. Imagine a rocket and rocket fuel. Rocket fuel is great, is massively combustable, produces huge amounts of energy. However, if you just light it , it'll just burn up (and maybe take the building down with it). I liken rocket fuel to the drive/energy to get shit done it's a scalar. The rocket on on the other hand, is raying to get somewhere,, it has a destination in mind. Without some energy, it's just going to sit on the Tarmac. I liken this to vision/direction. Put the two together and the rocket, will direct the energy in a certain direction so that the rocket can actually get somewhere. You need both in order to create the relevant velocity to get somewhere.
