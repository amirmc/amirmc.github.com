MSFT BizSpark Camp

Intro from Mark Taylor

Future is about three things. Apps, Cloud, Sensing. 
Apps is the idea of something highly accessible that doesn't need complicated stuff to use/find. Fundamental challenge is consumer expectation. 368540 apps in apple app store. 79024 is the number of inactive apps in store. However, those folks who make a 79p app are suddenly stuck with a bunch of users who expect updates and support. The biz model for apps is not yet clear so still need to work on this 

$500mm is what MSFT spent to set up Azure. So now an app can become a container for running something in the cloud. Also allows a different service based relationship which is stronger biz model. Long way to go before we can consider 'cloud' as utility yet. If can access it and filter it throu apps then theeres an interesting proposition. 

Fastest selling consumer electronic product of all time is the Kinect. Right now, mainly for gaming. Immersive experience. Trade off is that it plugs into a console and needs to be real time, hence limits the number of positions that can be searched. However in near future MSFT announcing an SDK for Kinect on PC. 

Tis kind of stuff give people a whole new way of interacting with devices. Right now ppl spending lots of money on making capacitative screens but in future you can have low costs screen and gestural stuff to interact

Different types of innovations. Some are groundbreaking, like the first mouse. Others are improvements, eg dyson, CDs. Some are commoditisers. Eg what Ford did for Cars. these are all valid. 

Before joining MSFT Mark was in a startup doing mortgage software. Back in 1990 small companies tried to behave like big companies. I 2011 Big companies try to behave like small companies. Top 10 in-demand jobs today did not exist in 2004. Primarily, due to new technologies. Its one of the things to ride rather than resist. 

Comparing beta of Gmail and MSFT. google did a beta for 7yrs but pretty much complete. MSFT beta is more raw product. 


Exceedra - Insight Driven Planning
Retail Data Analytics
Initially went with SQL Azure. Zero upfront investment, transparent to clients. 
What they learnt: 
Expensive to be big. Think small. - get architecture right(disk space matters)
Develop and test locally - use migration wizard. Don't pay for testing. 
Make use of Azure deleting services
Only reply when ready. Make sure it works.

[got to say. Sometimes boring PowerPoint slides are a nice breather. Easier to take notes based on them.]

Richard Parker MyDeo - provider of CDN services

Andy - AllMyPlans - financial plans management 

Simon Karn - Pricing and Promotions. Windows Azure incubation. Incubation is for getting biz model around propositions. it's not a mature market. Lots of things still need to be learned. Critical thing to get across is that it's a granular pricing model. Has implications for types of biz model. E.g standard licensing or passing on cost as cost of goods. MSFT currently in journey of exploring option around azure. Because platform charges in granular way you learn how your apps work and the cost base and will prob talk to MSFT about how to license your work in the best way. critical thing is learning the characteristics of the applications you've built. 

Only started charging for azure 12mths ago. Charging about 7p an hour per CPU. There are about 6/7 purchasing 'meters' (WTF). Being conscious of what you have running in cloud is important. however, understanding the detail isn't that important since you can learn the characteristics. Then you can tune your applications. 

Interesting model since you can deploy to any of 6 data centers but be billed where your legal entity is. Means deployment cost to other places is largely flat. 

Andrew O'Conner - InishTech - Monetising the Cloud
Protect
License
Manage
Monetize
 
Cloud will change the sw biz utterly! I terms of product dev, professional services, sales (snowflakes VS snowballs), marketing. 
How to monetize
- decide on strategy
  Move data storage
  Move data processing
  Create SaaS versions of app
- get your head right
  I am a service provider
  Service is most important thing
  Support is central
- put money where mouth is
 
Rethink sales marketing
- pipeline
- target market
- target audience
- field sales VS tele-managed
- channel strategy
- 24x7 online, try before buy
- live demo
- app stores / vertical marketplaces / ecosystem
- online marketing sel

Consider biz model
- how to package for market (diff SKUs)
- how to move bgwm Skus
- provisioning tenants and managing access
- price/value
- how to connect to CRM and Billing

Become agile
- customer centric sw
- seamless switching
- license compliance - prevent rev leakage
- tight feedback loop for improvements

Regular health checks
- MRR
- pipeline
- CoA
- Cash Flow
- Churn

Mine your data
- bigg diff bgwm software vendor and SaaS provider
- bis intelligence can be more valuable than customer. 

MyDeo
Azure has saved them thousands. 

Exceedra
Commercial Planning: 15-20% of revenue goes into BOGOF offers
Supply Chain Planning: if you manage this you can predict better
Retail Data Analytics: manufactures get lots of data from tescos et al but dunno what to do with it. 

Approach and benefits of Azure
- about value and USPs not Tech
- Faster sales cycle (v important - allows smaller initial spends)
- increased market
- Faster implementation
- MSFT brand value (for enterprise customers)
[Great talk]
