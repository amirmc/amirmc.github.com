[Amir Chaudhry][amir] hopes to make [unikernels][] accessible to
developers everywhere, and is the Community Manager for [MirageOS][]. Most of
his time is spent on open source efforts and he's a big fan of automation to
maximise developer impact. In previous lives he was a
Member of Technical Staff at [Docker][], Programme Manager at
[OCaml Labs][], led operations at a medical device start-up, created a seed
investing programme, and was a board observer at another startup.
Amir also has a diverse academic background with an MSci in Physics and a PhD
in Neuroscience. When not working on unikernels, Amir is probably looking at
the sky and wondering when he can next go skydiving.

<!-- Amir is Programme Manager in the [OCaml Labs][] group at the 
[Cambridge Computer Laboratory][CL]. His industrial experience ranges from 
early-stage startups ([CTC][], [GoTestIt][]) to blue chip multi-nationals 
([NGG plc][]) and he has worked on Special Projects at Red Gate Software. He 
co-founded the [Springboard][] accelerator programme (now part of 
[Techstars][]), funding four teams for three months in Cambridge. Following 
this, he led an investment into one of the companies and served as Board 
Observer. Amir also led [Cambridge University Entrepreneurs][CUE], where he 
founded the software competition, based on the principle of developing 
prototypes rather than business plans. Amir has a diverse academic 
background with an MSci in Physics and a PhD in Neuroscience -->
