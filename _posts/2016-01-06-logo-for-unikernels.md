I've been working towards a logo for unikernels and it's time to gather
feedback from the unikernel community! There's been a 99designs contest
running for a while — where designers have submitted just over 400
entries — and a short-list for community feedback is now at
<https://99designs.co.uk/logo-design/vote-99gjyi> (link open until at least 15th Jan).

At this stage, the aim is to gather wider feedback to inform the next step.
The final design will be selected *at a later date* — after further iteration
with designers.  Once a logo is chosen, it will be used on [unikernel.org][]
and will help inform the design of the rest of the site (with input from a
professional firm).

For more background you can read the [design brief][1] and you can even look
through [all the entries][2].


### Why do unikernels need a logo?

The unikernel approach as a *concept* has been getting much more attention
recently and this will only increase throughout 2016.

Since there are a number of different [projects][] — each approaching the
problem from a different perspective — it will become even more important to
ease the process of bringing in new users and contributors across all the
projects.

The website at [unikernel.org][] is already helping with this but we will also
need a simple visual identity to go alongside it.  Building this kind of brand
will greatly improve the standing of unikernels as a whole and will be just as
important as the work going on in each of the implementations. Ultimately,
this will help to increase the rate of adoption.


### What about projects' existing logos?

To avoid any confusion, I'll say upfront that this logo is **not** intended to
replace any project's existing brand!  It's meant to help us represent
unikernels *as a whole* and each project will make it own choices, just as
they do currently.  The logo will mainly be used on [unikernel.org][] and
projects can make use of it if they wish.

Projects have already [benefited from shared code][ec2-script] and the same
will be true from this shared brand.

### What now?
