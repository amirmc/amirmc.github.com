### Summary

For those who don’t want to read the rest, here’s what you do.

1.  Visit the free service [MashiCal](http://www.mashical.com) & create
    a calendar
2.  Add each of your iCal feeds to your MashiCal calendar (adjust
    settings as appropriate)
3.  Copy the subscribe link (right-click and ‘copy link’ on the
    aggregated calendar)

You now have a link to an aggregated iCal feed of your calendar!\
 Below is the rest of the post for those with more patience ;)

### Why would anyone need to do this?

If you have multiple calendars, sharing free/busy information becomes
painful. One result is that too much time can be spent scheduling
meetings.\*

If I could combine all the calendar feeds into one free/busy feed then
I’d only have to share that one calendar with colleagues. So far none of
the applications I use are able to do this intelligently, and that’s
without the additional complexity of having multiple calendars in each
application.

Enter MashiCal.

### Using MashiCal to merge .ics feeds

I was already using BusyCal from [BusyMac](http://www.busymac.com) so my
Apple iCal calendars sync with Google quite nicely. Therefore, I only
need to worry about getting my Google and Outlook calendars into one
feed. (NB It’s possible to publish a feed directly from Apple iCal so
you don’t need to buy any software)

#### Getting a feed from Google

To get your ics feed from your google calendar, visit the calendar’s
settings page. Make sure the calendar is shared otherwise the feed will
not work.

#### Getting a feed from Outlook

In Outlook 2007 you’ll need to right-click on the calendar you want to
create a feed for and “Publish to Internet”. When you’re prompted to
share the feed you just created you’ll be able to see the URL you need.

#### Aggregating the feeds

Now that you have the iCal feeds you want to aggregate, visit MashiCal
and put them together. The interface is quite simple and MashiCal will
produce an Agenda view and provide a link at the top of the calendar
that you can share.

Be aware of the calendar settings for each feed you are entering since
timezones and refresh schedules may be relevant. Once it’s done you’ll
have a aggregated iCal feed that you can share with others. You can see
what my free/busy feed looks like
[here](http://www.mashical.com/cal?id=34df5231-84c6-475b-981e-6370459a84fb).
I’ve also collated my calendars into a general
[free/busy](http://amirchaudhry.com/pages/freebusy) page too.

I hope this was useful. I wrote this since it took me a while to
discover MashiCal and thought it might be useful for others too.

*\*I’m aware there are services that try and solve this problem (e.g
[MeetWithMe](http://MeetWith.me) and [Tungle.Me](http://www.tungle.me)
come to mind). However, I’m more interested in having an aggregated
free/busy feed which people can subscribe to.*

This is cool. The scenario that really needs to be solved is... 2 working parents needing to view each others work schedules as well as personal appointments, maybe personal hotmail or gmail calendars at home and each has an outlook calendar on different work domains. And maybe throw in a teenager's schedule into the mix. Some details you want all to see and some you want to keep private but busy. Now take these calendars and figure out how to view them on each parent's phone. I've been playing with outlook connector which is great when you're at a pc, but the phone experience is missing and you really need that when you're on the road. Has anyone figured out the aggregate when multiple people are involved, and how to do it cleanly on phones?
