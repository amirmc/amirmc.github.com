### BCPA Monthly Draw – June

I’m the guy in the white helmet.

The above was my first attempt at a proper 3-way skydive. If you look closely it becomes obvious that I’m being dragged around. I’ve clearly got some work to do before I can keep up with these guys by myself. We did get 7 or 8 points though!

#### About the video

The [BCPA][] is the national student body that promotes skydiving. Every month there’s a draw of three formations. The idea is to complete the sequence of formations (and repeat) as many times as possible within the time allowed (35sec).

June was the last draw of this academic year and the formations in the video are Sputnik, Opal and Cluster. The divepool these formations came from can be found [here][]
