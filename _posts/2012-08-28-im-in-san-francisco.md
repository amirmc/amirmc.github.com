Actually, I've been here for a while now and feeling (mostly) settled in.  I'm in the US for another couple of months, most of which will be in SF, with a short trip to Colorado and New York thrown in.

So far, I've met a bunch of folks from 'back home', people that they know, and a handful of new ones.  While I'm out here, I'm hoping to meet a lot more people who might be interested in the work we're doing in the Lab.  Specifically things related to Software Defined Networking, Identity and Functional Programming -- basically anything that overlaps with projects like [Signpost][] and [Mirage][] (if you happen to know anyone, bonus points for putting me in touch).

I've also managed to get out of town, courtesy of friends-with-a-car, and saw the [Monterey Aquarium][] (some pics below).  Not been hiking yet but will hopefully make it out of town again at some point.

Overall, SF is a very interesting place and I can see the draw for people to come here.  Although a lot of the companies are further south, there's much more 'stuff' happening here.  I'm looking forward to the next couple of months.
