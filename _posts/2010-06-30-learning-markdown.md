### My first attempt at markdown

Having come across [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) some time ago, I’ve decided to give it a try. This post is basically my attempt at using as many of the tags as possible. At least those I’m likely to
need.

* * * * *

#### Reasons

-   More control over how how posts *look*
-   To be able to **emphasise** things in plain text
-   Because I prefer using plain text email

As Gruber says:

> Markdown’s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format
> for writing for the web

I’m hoping I can get used to it. The last thing I need is to give myself
another roadblock to writing.

*edit: I didn’t get the list stuff correct the first time around*
