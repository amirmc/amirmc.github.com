Wow. Random fact of the day.

Apparently the recommended daily amount of Manganese is around few milligrams per day (some sites say up to a max of 11mg per day). The average cup of black tea has 0.2-0.8 mg of Manganese. Other sources of the mineral include soy, rice and beans and coffee (though I couldn't find how much there was in coffee)
