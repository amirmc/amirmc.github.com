From the infographic below.

> - "Odds of dying while skydiving in the US: 1 in 101,083"
> - "Dance parties: 1 in 100,000 chance of dying"

Wonder what the [BCPA][] would make of this, since they recklessly combine both Skydiving *and* parties on a regular basis (how extreme).

Seriously though, this nicely depicts that many things have *worse* odds than skydiving (although comparisons like this should be taken with a pinch of salt).  However, base jumping (which is not the same thing as skydiving) seems to be the most dangerous by far (1 in 60).
