circles yet.</i></small>

Skype has been great for conference calls and video calls but it's
nearly always been a hassle with more than 2 people. It's analogous to
the way in which phones work i.e great when only two people need to talk
but confusing to set up if there are more.

Although it's different, Hangout might obviate the need to use Skype
video again. Having multiple people, with cameras, all in one 'room' and
effectively with one-click sounds fantastic. Of course, I haven't tried
it yet but I can imagine not needing to use Skype video again.

Skype will still have it's place (for now) since I find it useful to see
who's online and ask quick questions via IM. However, even that benefit
might disappear in time.

I'm curious to know what other people think.
