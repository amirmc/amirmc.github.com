I heard this today.  It made me stop and think so I decided to look it up.

> *"The real problem of humanity is the following:
> we have paleolithic emotions; medieval institutions; 
> and god-like technology. 
> And it is terrifically dangerous,
> and it is now approaching a point of crisis overall."*
