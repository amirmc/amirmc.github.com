One of the useful but slightly odd things that stuck with me from school came from one of the teachers I really didn't like. I never thought that particular class would have any relevance to the Rest Of My Life but here I am thinking about it.

That one thing was a phrase that the teacher kept repeating, week after week. Anyone from my school will know exactly who I'm talking about.

Ok, so the 'explain fully' part wasn't entirely explained (the irony), but I've found the general principle to be helpful when I'm trying to get my thoughts on paper.

Make your point. Provide some evidence. Explain it clearly.
