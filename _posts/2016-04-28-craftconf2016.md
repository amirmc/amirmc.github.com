These are the slides from my [talk at Craft Conf][talk] today. If you're
reading this at the conference now, please do follow the link at the end of my
talk to rate it and give me feedback!

Some of the specific items I mention are below, with links to more detail.
You can find more information and resources about unikernels over at
**[unikernel.org][]**.

#### Build the MirageOS website with Docker for Mac

I quickly showed people how to build and serve the MirageOS website from a
container on my Mac.  I used the [Docker for Mac beta][d4mac] (beta 8) for
this, together with a prepared Docker image. Bear in mind that things change
across beta releases so if the following doesn't work, please
[tweet me][twitter].

To follow my steps in the demo:

```bash
# On your terminal
$ docker run -it -p 80:80 amirmc/demo-craft bash

# Inside the container
$ cd mirage-www/src
$ mirage configure --unix --net socket
$ make
$ sudo ./mir-www
```

You should be able to see the site by pointing your browser to `localhost`!
Congrats, you just built MirageOS! You can read the [hello world guide][guide] on the website to understand more about the configure flags we used.

The above image (`amirmc/demo-craft`) is one I made just for the conference,
so that I didn't have to wait for additional downloads. To do it 'properly',
it's better to use the [unikernel/mirage images][mirage-images], since those
are maintained.  The `mirage` tool within the container will then pull down
the required dependencies based on the `mirage configure` step. 

```bash
# Clone the repo on your machine
$ git clone https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www.git
$ cd mirage-www

# Pull and run the maintained image, mount
# the local directory, and set up the ports
$ docker run -it -v `pwd`:/src -p 80:80 unikernel/mirage bash

# Now that you're in the container
$ cd src
$ mirage configure --unix --net socket # installs packages
$ make
$ sudo ./mir-www
```

Then point your browser at `localhost`.

Using Docker for Mac makes all of the above much easier, *especially* if you
don't have (or don't want) a local OCaml environment set up.

#### The Bitcoin Piñata

This is a unikernel, built using the TLS stack, which holds the private key to
some bitcoin.  If you manage to break in then you can simply transfer the
bitcoin away.  The model itself is a novel way to run a bounty programme,
since a successful breach leads directly to the reward — though the main
benefit is to stress-test the whole stack in the wild.  In the talk, I
describe how the unikernel is about 4% the size of it's equivalent in a
traditional OS and you can read the article for more detail about that
(and much more).
