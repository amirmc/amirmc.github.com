\[Missed session 2 due to Apple Mail + Wireless fail.\]

Ian Lunn from Product Focus

Only handful of ppl put hand up to Q of "who thinks they're a good PM" :)

Product Focus do survey on ProdMgmnt.
 - Ave PM has been a PM for 8.5yrs (up from 7.5yrs last yr)
 - 44% of time spent on firefighting and 56% on planned activities "too much time on tactical"
 - lack of clarity on role/responsibility
 - 51% of projects delivered on time (some ppl in room think that's
high)

Effective ProdMgmnt. Now we have a 2x2 matrix \[notepad ain't gonna help me w that\]. Axes are knowledge/skills and actions.

8 Personas
 - Numbers Guy
 - Subject Matter Expert
 - Expert Compromiser
 - Troubleshooter: Wild West Style
 - Product Champion/Advocate
 - Voice of Market
 - Reliable Project Manager
 - Multi-CEO (bit of everything)

Biggest issue in ProdMgmnt in companies seems to be:
 - Lack of clarity on roles
 - lack of time for strategy
 - Ave salary is Â£61k base (cue murmurs from room...)

Job titles can be misleading. Can split work by activities.
 - Strategic PM Activities: Working out the right product
 - Inbound Activities: Helping business deliver the product
 - Outbound Activities: Helping business to sell the product

Q. Has the role of PM changed over the years as it becomes more
recognised? <br />
A. Still a way to go. Better recognised but need more exposure.
