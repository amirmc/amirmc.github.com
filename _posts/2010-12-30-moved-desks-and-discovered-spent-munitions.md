![Weapons stockpile](/images/weapons-stockpile.jpg)

I just moved desks from one side of the room to the other. While messing
with the cabling I also cleared out a bunch of nerf bullets from under
the desk.

As if that's not ominous enough, behind me is what appears to be the
weapons stockpile (see pic above).

I'd like to think that the New Year will bring peace, love and harmony
to this part of the building but that would be crazy talk.

I'm going to be Switzerland (or maybe the Red Cross).
