This sounds like great work and it's one of the things I wanted to study just before I started my PhD. Interesting to see that performance correlates with social sensitivity as well as the proportion of females in the group. I'd be very interested to know exactly what *kinds* of tasks the teams were asked to perform.

I'll have to wait till I'm next on campus before I can download the paper itself.
