There is a work-in-progress site at 
[ocaml-redesign.github.io](http://ocaml-redesign.github.io), where we've 
been developing both the tools and design for the new ocaml.org pages.  This 
allows us to test our tools and fix issues before we consider merging 
changes upstream.

There is a more detailed post coming about all the design work to date and 
the workflow we're using, but in the meantime, feedback on the following 
areas would be most welcome.  Please leave feedback in the form of issues on 
the [ocaml.org sandbox repo](https://github.com/ocamllabs/sandbox-ocaml.org/issues).  

1. **OCaml Logo** - There was some feedback on the last iteration of the 
logo, especially regarding the font, so there are now several options to 
consider.  Please look at the images on the 
[ocaml.org GitHub wiki](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Draft-OCaml-Logos) and then leave your feedback on 
[issue #16 on the sandbox repo](https://github.com/ocamllabs/sandbox-ocaml.org/issues/16).

2. **Site design** - Please do give feedback on the design and any glitches 
you notice. Text on each of the new landing pages is still an initial draft 
so comments and improvements there are also welcome (specifically: Home 
Page, Learn, Documentation, Platform, Community). There are already a few 
[known issues](https://github.com/ocamllabs/sandbox-ocaml.org/issues), so do 
add your comments to those threads first.
