                <title>Scientific evidence for health supplements</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an update to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/scientific-evidence-for-health-supplements/&quot;&gt;earlier version&lt;/a&gt; of this infographic, which I
came across two years ago.  It was interesting at the time since it did a
good job at displaying the myriad supplements in a way that indicated both
their likely efficacy, according to research papers, and how popular the
search term was.  For example, the previous image showed 'strong' evidence
for licorice root as an aid for coughs, but it had a much smaller search
volume than the equivalently effective fish-oil for blood pressure.  I also
really liked the concept of the 'Worth it Line'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphic has been updated a couple of times now, with the most recent
change a few weeks ago.  There are quite a few differences as garlic didn't
feature so prominently on the previous image and it looks like a number of
things may have been removed (e.g licorice root).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D, as beneficial to general health, is still way up there.  I
decided to try Vitamin D3 supplements over the winter, under the theory that
I'm not getting enough sun so a supplement may be useful.  I was quite
surprised at how much better I felt after a day or so of taking it, to the
point where I tried looking up work on Vitamin D and mood*.  Scanning the
research seemed to indicate that there may be links between Vitamin D,
serotonin levels and depression but the extent isn't clear and conclusions
were mixed.  Of course, that mostly supports what the infographic is saying
and it puts it above the 'Worth it Line' (for depression specifically but
not general 'mood' per se).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to go visit the site as there's an
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/play/snake-oil-supplements/&quot;&gt;interactive version&lt;/a&gt;, where you can highlight a bubble to get more
info and be transported to the main study it references.  If you like, you
can also dig into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/snakeoilsupps&quot;&gt;spreadsheet itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Switching from Bootstrap to Zurb Foundation</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I've just updated my site's HTML/CSS and moved from Twitter Bootstrap to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/features.html&quot;&gt;Zurb Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.  This post captures my subjective notes on the
migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;My use of Bootstrap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I originally set this site up, I didn't know what frameworks existed or
anything more than the basics of dealing with HTML (and barely any CSS).  I
came across Twitter Bootstrap and immediately decided it would Solve All My
Problems.  It really did.  Since then, I've gone through one 'upgrade' with
Bootstrap (from 1.x to 2.x), after which I dutifully ignored all the fixes
and improvements (note that Bootstrap was up to v2.3.2 while I was still
using v2.0.2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/switch-to-foundation/responsive-design.png&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive Design&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, this was fine with me but for a while now, I've been
meaning to make this site 'responsive' (read: not look like crap from a
mobile).  Bootstrap v3 purports to be mobile-first so upgrading would likely
give me what I'm after but v3 is &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/&quot;&gt;not backwards compatible&lt;/a&gt;,
meaning I'd have to rewrite parts of the HTML.  Since this step was
unavoidable, it led me to have another look at front-end frameworks, just to
see if I was missing anything.  This was especially relevant since we'd
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/announcing-new-ocamlorg/&quot;&gt;just released&lt;/a&gt; the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org&quot;&gt;OCaml.org&lt;/a&gt;
website, itself built with Bootstrap v2.3.1 (we'd done the design/templating
work long before v3 was released).  It would be useful to know what else is
out there for any future work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this time I discovered Zurb Foundation and also the numerous
comparisons between them (note: Foundation seems to come out ahead in most
of those).  A few days ago, the folks at Zurb released
&lt;a href=&quot;http://zurb.com/article/1280/foundation-5-blasts-off--2&quot;&gt;version 5&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided that now is the time to kick the
tires.  For the last few days, I've been playing with the framework and in
the end I decided to migrate my site over completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/features.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/switch-to-foundation/zurb-yeti.png&quot; alt=&quot;Foundation's Yeti&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Swapping out one framework for another&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, I've become moderately experienced with HTML/CSS and I can
usually wrangle things to look the way I want, but my solutions aren't
necessarily elegant. I was initially concerned that I'd already munged
things so much that changing anything would be a pain.  When I first put the
styles for this site together, I had to spend quite a bit of time
overwriting Bootstrap's defaults so I was prepared for the same when using
Foundation.  Turns out that I was fine.  I currently use &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; (and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;) so I only had three template files and a couple of
HTML pages to edit and because I'd kept most of my custom CSS in a separate
file, it was literally a case of swapping out one framework for another and
bug-fixing from there onwards.  There's definitely a lesson here in using
automation as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customising the styles was another area of concern but I was pleasantly
surprised to find I needed &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; customisation than with Bootstrap.  This
is likely because I didn't have to override as many defaults (and probably
because I've learned more about CSS since then).  The one thing I seemed to
be missing was a way to deal with code sections, so I just took what
Bootstrap had and copied it in.  At some point I should revisit this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did take me a while to get my head around Foundation's grid but it was
worth it in the end.  The idea is that you should design for small screens
first and then adjust things for larger screens as necessary. There are
several different default sizes which inherit their properties from the size
below, unless you explicitly override them.  I initially screwed this up by
explicitly defining the grid using the &lt;code&gt;small-#&lt;/code&gt; classes, which obviously
looks ridiculous on small screens.  I fixed it by swapping out &lt;code&gt;small-#&lt;/code&gt; for
&lt;code&gt;medium-#&lt;/code&gt; everywhere in the HTML, after which everything looked reasonable.
Items flowed sensibly into a default column for the small screens and looked
acceptable for larger screens and perfectly fine on desktops.  I could do
more styling of the mobile view but I'd already achieved most of what I was
after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Fixing image galleries and embedded content&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only additional thing I used from Bootstrap was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel&quot;&gt;Carousel&lt;/a&gt;. I'd
written some custom helper scripts that would take some images and
thumbnails from a specified folder and produce clickable thumbnails with a
slider underneath.  Foundation provides &lt;a href=&quot;http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/orbit.html&quot;&gt;Orbit&lt;/a&gt;, so I had to spend time
rewriting my script to produce the necessary HTML.  This actually resulted
in cleaner HTML and one of the features I wanted (the ability to link to a
specific image) was available by default in Orbit.  At this point I also
tried to make the output look better for the case where JavaScript is
disabled (in essence, each image is just displayed as a list).  Below is an
example of an image gallery, taken from a previous post, when I
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/joined-the-computer-lab/&quot;&gt;joined the computer lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;
  &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The gallery needs JavaScript but I've tried to make it degrade gracefully. -Amir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
  &lt;ul class=&quot;inline-list&quot;&gt;
    
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-orbit-link=&quot;join-comp-lab-1&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-thumb-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;join-comp-lab-thumb-1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-orbit-link=&quot;join-comp-lab-2&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-thumb-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;join-comp-lab-thumb-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-orbit-link=&quot;join-comp-lab-3&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-thumb-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;join-comp-lab-thumb-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;ul data-orbit data-options=&quot;next_on_click:true; timer_speed:3000; pause_on_hover:false; bullets:false;&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;li class=&quot;gallery-image&quot; data-orbit-slide=&quot;join-comp-lab-1&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;join-comp-lab-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    
    &lt;li class=&quot;gallery-image&quot; data-orbit-slide=&quot;join-comp-lab-2&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;join-comp-lab-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    
    &lt;li class=&quot;gallery-image&quot; data-orbit-slide=&quot;join-comp-lab-3&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;join-comp-lab-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Foundation also provides a component called &lt;a href=&quot;http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/flex_video.html&quot;&gt;Flex Video&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the
browser to scale videos to the appropriate size.  This fix was as simple as
going back through old posts and wrapping anything that was &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in a
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;flex-video&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  It really was that simple and all the Vimeo and
YouTube items scaled perfectly.  Here's an example of a video from an
earlier post, where I gave a &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/&quot;&gt;walkthrough of the ocaml.org site&lt;/a&gt;.
Try changing the width of your browser window to see it scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-video widescreen vimeo&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/61768157?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=de9e6a&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen=&quot;true&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; allowFullScreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Video demo&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Framework differences&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of the main difference between the two frameworks is that Bootstrap
uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesscss.org&quot;&gt;LESS&lt;/a&gt; to manage its CSS whereas Foundation uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com&quot;&gt;SASS&lt;/a&gt;.  Frankly,
I've no experience with either of them so it makes little difference to me.
It's worth bearing in mind for anyone who's workflow does involve
pre-processing.  Also, Bootstrap is available under the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#license-faqs&quot;&gt;Apache 2 License&lt;/a&gt;, while Foundation is released under
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/faq.html#question-3&quot;&gt;MIT license&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the transition was pretty painless and most of the time was spent
getting familiar with the grid, hunting for docs/examples and trying to make
the image gallery work the way I wanted.  I do think Bootstrap's docs are
better but Foundation's aren't bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this isn't meant to be a comparison, I much prefer Foundation to
Bootstrap.  If you're not sure which to use then I think the secret is in
the names of the frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bootstrap (for me) was a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; way to '&lt;em&gt;bootstrap&lt;/em&gt;' a site quickly with
lots of acceptable defaults -- it was quick to get started but took some
work to alter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foundation seems to provide a great '&lt;em&gt;foundation&lt;/em&gt;' on which to create more
customised sites -- it's more flexible but needs more upfront thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much how I'd recommend them to people now.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Announcing the new OCaml.org</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;As some of you may have noticed, the new OCaml.org site is now live!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DNS may still be propagating so if &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org&quot;&gt;http://ocaml.org&lt;/a&gt; hasn't updated for you then try http://166.78.252.20.  This post is in two parts: the first is the announcement and the second is a call for content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New OCaml.org website design!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new site represents a major milestone in the continuing growth of the OCaml ecosystem. It's the culmination of a lot of volunteer work over the last several months and I'd specifically like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Chris00&quot;&gt;Christophe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ashishagarwal.org&quot;&gt;Ashish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://philippewang.info/CL/&quot;&gt;Philippe&lt;/a&gt; for their dedication (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/commits/master&quot;&gt;commit logs&lt;/a&gt; speak volumes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/ann-new-ocamlorg/ocaml-home-wire.png&quot; alt=&quot;OCaml.org Wireframes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began this journey just over 8 months ago with paper, pencils and a lot of ideas. This led to a comprehensive set of &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/&quot;&gt;wireframes and walk-throughs&lt;/a&gt; of the site, which then developed into a collection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Site-Redesign&quot;&gt;Photoshop mockups&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, these formed the basis for the html templates and style sheets, which we've adapted to fit our needs across the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the design process, we also considered the kind of structure and &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/infrastructure/2013-July/000211.html&quot;&gt;workflow we aspired to&lt;/a&gt;, both as maintainers and contributors.  This led us to develop completely new tools for &lt;a href=&quot;http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-09-05-22-31-26-about-omd.html&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-10-03-20-35-12-using-mpp-two-different-ways.html&quot;&gt;templating&lt;/a&gt; in OCaml, which are now available in OPAM for the benefit all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on all these things in parallel definitely had it challenges (which I'll write about separately) but the result has been worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/ann-new-ocamlorg/ocaml-home-mockup.png&quot; alt=&quot;OCaml.org&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey is ongoing and we still have many more improvements we hope to make. The site you see today primarily improves upon the design, structure and workflows but in time, we also intend to incorporate more information on packages and documentation. With the new tooling, moving the website forward will become much easier and I hope that more members of the community become involved in the generation and curation of content.  This brings me to the second part of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Call for content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have lots of great content on the website but there are parts that could do with a refresh and gaps that could be filled.  As a community driven site, we need ongoing contributions to ensure that the site best reflects its members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you do commercial work on OCaml then maybe you'd like to add yourself to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org/community/support.html&quot;&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt;? Perhaps there are tutorials you can help to complete, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html&quot;&gt;99 problems&lt;/a&gt;?  If you're not sure where to begin, there are already a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues?labels=content&quot;&gt;content issues&lt;/a&gt; you could contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we've gone through a bug-hunt already, feedback on the site is still very welcome.  You can either &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues&quot;&gt;create an issue&lt;/a&gt; on the tracker (preferred), or email the infrastructure list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's fantastic how far we've come and I look forward to the next phase!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Migration plan for the OCaml.org redesign</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;We're close to releasing the new design of ocaml.org but need help from the
OCaml community to identify and fix bugs before we switch next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashish, Christophe, Philippe and I have been discussing how we should go
about this and below is the plan for migration.  If anyone would like to
discuss any of this, then the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure&quot;&gt;infrastructure list&lt;/a&gt; is the best
place to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've made a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/tree/redesign&quot;&gt;new branch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the main ocaml.org repository with
the redesign.  This branch is a fork of the master and we've simply cleaned
up and replayed our git commits there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've built a live version of the new site, which is visible at
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://preview.ocaml.org&quot;&gt;http://preview.ocaml.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - this is rebuilt every few minutes
from the branch mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of one week, we ask the community to review the new site
and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues&quot;&gt;report any bugs or problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the issue tracker. We &lt;em&gt;triage&lt;/em&gt;
those bugs to identify any blockers and work on those first.  This is the
phase we'll be in from &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one week (7 days), and after blocking bugs have been fixed, we
&lt;strong&gt;merge the redesign branch&lt;/strong&gt; into the master branch.  This would
effectively present the new site to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;During the above, we would not be able to accept any new pull requests on
the master branch but would be happy to accept them on the new, redesign
branch.  Hence, restricting the time frame to one week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that the above is only intended to merge the &lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;toolchain&lt;/em&gt; for the new site.  Specifically, we've created new landing
pages, have new style sheets and have restructured the site's contents as
well as made some new libraries (&lt;a href=&quot;http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-09-05-22-31-26-about-omd.html&quot;&gt;OMD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-10-03-20-39-07-OPAMaging-MPP.html&quot;&gt;MPP&lt;/a&gt;). The new toolchain
means people can write files in markdown, which makes contributing content a
lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the files are on GitHub, people don't even need to clone the site
locally to make simple edits (or even add new pages). Just click the 'Edit
this page' link in the footer to be taken to the right file in the
repository and GitHub's editing and pull request features will allow you to
make changes and submit updates, all from within your browser (see the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-files-in-your-repository&quot;&gt;GitHub Article&lt;/a&gt; for details).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still work to be done on adding new features but the above changes
are already a great improvement to the site and are ready to be reviewed by
the OCaml community and merged.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Review of the OCaml FPDays tutorial</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fpdays.net/2013/sessions/index.php?session=24&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 10px&quot; src=&quot;/images/web/fpdays-logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Last Thursday a bunch of us from the OCaml Labs team gave an OCaml tutorial
at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fpdays.net/2013/sessions/index.php?session=24&quot;&gt;FPDays&lt;/a&gt; conference (an event for people interested in Functional
Programming).  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yallop&quot;&gt;Jeremy&lt;/a&gt; and I led the session with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lpw25.net&quot;&gt;Leo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dsheets&quot;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://philippewang.info/CL/&quot;&gt;Philippe&lt;/a&gt; helping everyone progress and dealing with questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 10px&quot; src=&quot;/images/fpdays2013/fpdays2013-01.jpg&quot;&gt;
It turned out to be by far the &lt;em&gt;most popular session&lt;/em&gt; at the conference with
over 20 people all wanting to get to grips with OCaml!  An excellent turnout
and a great indicator of the interest that's out there, especially when you
offer a hands-on session to people.  This shouldn't be a surprise as we've
had good attendance for the general &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-NonDysFunctional-Programmers/&quot;&gt;OCaml meetups&lt;/a&gt; I've run
and also the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocamllabs.github.io/compiler-hacking/2013/09/17/compiler-hacking-july-2013.html&quot;&gt;compiler hacking sessions&lt;/a&gt;, which Jeremy and
Leo have been building up (do sign up if you're interested in either of
those!).  We had a nice surprise for attendees, which were
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley_proof&quot;&gt;uncorrected proof&lt;/a&gt; copies of Real World OCaml and luckily, we had just
enough to go around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the tutorial itself, Jeremy put together a nice sequence of exercises
and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocamllabs/fpdays-skeleton&quot;&gt;skeleton repo&lt;/a&gt; (with helpful comments in the code) so that people
could dive in quickly.  The event was set up to be really informal and the
rough plan was as following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Installation/Intro&lt;/em&gt; - We checked that people had been able to follow the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/fpdays-ocaml-session/&quot;&gt;installation instructions&lt;/a&gt;, which we'd sent them in advance.
We also handed out copies of the book and made sure folks were comfortable
with &lt;a href=&quot;http://opam.ocaml.org&quot;&gt;OPAM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello world&lt;/em&gt; - A light intro to get people familiar with the OCaml
syntax and installing packages with OPAM. This would also help people to get
familiar with the toolchain, workflow and compilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monty Hall browser game&lt;/em&gt; - Using &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;js_of_ocaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we wanted
people to create and run the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem&quot;&gt;Monty Hall problem&lt;/a&gt; in their
browser.  This would give people a taste of some real world interaction by
having to deal with the DOM and interfaces.  If folks did well, they could
add code to keep logs of the game results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Client-server game&lt;/em&gt; - The previous game was all in the browser (so could
be examined by players) so here the task was to split it into a client and
server, ensuring the two stay in sync.  This would demonstrate the
re-usability of the OCaml code already written and give people a feel for
client server interactions. If people wanted to do more, they could use
&lt;a href=&quot;http://opam.ocaml.org/pkg/ctypes/0.1.1/&quot;&gt;ctypes&lt;/a&gt; and get better random numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We did manage to stick to the overall scheme as above and we think this is a
great base from which to improve future tutorials.  It has the really nice
benefit of having visual, interactive elements and the ability to run things
both in the browser as well as on the server is a great way to show the
versatility of OCaml.  &lt;code&gt;js_of_ocaml&lt;/code&gt; is quite a mature tool and so it's
no surprise that it's also used by companies such as Facebook (see the recent
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKWNjFagR9k&quot;&gt;CUFP talk by Julien Verlaguet&lt;/a&gt; - skip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=gKWNjFagR9k#t=1149&quot;&gt;19:00&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned a lot from running this session so we've captured the good, the
bad and the ugly below.  This is useful for anyone who'd like to run an
OCaml tutorial in the future and also for us to be aware of the next
time we do this.  I've incorporated the feedback from the attendees as well
as our own thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fpdays2013/fpdays2013-03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Heads down and hands on&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Things we learnt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Good&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people really did follow the install instructions beforehand. This
made things so much easier on the day as we didn't have to worry about
compile times and people getting bored.  A few people had even got in touch
with me the night before to sort out installation problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many folks from OCaml Labs also came over to help people, which meant
no-one was waiting longer than around 10 seconds before getting help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had a good plan of the things we wanted to cover but we were happy to
be flexible and made it clear the aim was to get right into it.  Several
folks told us that they really appreciated this loose (as opposed to rigid)
structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn't spend any time lecturing the room but instead got people right
into the code.  Having enough of a skeleton to get something interesting
working was a big plus in this regard. People did progress from the early
examples to the later ones fairly well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had a VM with the correct set up that we could log people into if they
were having trouble locally.  Two people made use of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, It was great to have early proofs of the book and these were
well-received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fpdays2013/fpdays2013-02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RWO books galore!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bad&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our excitement to get right into the exercises, we didn't really give
an overview of OCaml and its benefits.  A few minutes at the beginning would
be enough and it's important so that people can leave with a few sound-bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone received my email about installation, and certainly not the
late arrivals.  This meant some pain getting things downloaded and running
especially due to the wifi (see 'Ugly' below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few of the people who &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; installed, didn't complete the instructions
fully but didn't realise this until the morning of the session.  There was a good
suggestion about having some kind of test to run that would check
everything, so you'd know if there was something missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We really should have had a cut-off where we told people to use VMs
instead of fixing installation issues and 10-15 minutes would have been
enough.  This would have been especially useful for the late-comers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn't really keep a record of the problems folks were having so we
can't now go back and fix underlying issues.  To be fair, this would have
been a little awkward to do ad-hoc but in hindsight, it's a good thing to
plan for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;The Ugly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only ugly part was the wifi.  It turned out that the room itself was a
bit of a dead-spot and that wasn't helped by 30ish devices trying to connect
to one access point!  Having everyone grab packages at the same time in the
morning probably didn't help.  It was especially tricky as all our
mitigation plans seemed to revolve around at least having local connectivity.
In any case, this problem only lasted for the morning session and was a
little better by the afternoon.  I'd definitely recommend a backup plan in
the case of complete wifi failure next time!  One such plan that Leo got
started on was to put the repository and other information onto a flash
drive that could be shared with people.  We didn't need this in the end but
it'll be useful to have something like this prepared for next time.  If
anyone fancies donating a bunch of flash drives, I'll happily receive them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a great session and everyone left happy, having completed
most of the tutorial (and with a book!).  A few even continued at home
afterwards and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richardclegg/status/393458073052139520&quot;&gt;got in touch&lt;/a&gt; to let us know that they got
everything working.
It was a great session and thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarkDalgarno&quot;&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JacquiDDavidson&quot;&gt;Jacqui&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of
the FPDays crew for a great conference!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>FP Days OCaml Session</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yallop&quot;&gt;Jeremy&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lpw25.net&quot;&gt;Leo&lt;/a&gt;, I'll be running an OCaml Hands-on Session at
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fpdays.net/2013/&quot;&gt;FPDays conference&lt;/a&gt;. Below are some prep
instructions for attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Preparation for the session&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're starting from scratch, installation can take some time so it's
best to get as much done in advance as possible.  You'll need OPAM (the
package manager), OCaml 4.01 (available through OPAM) and a few libraries
before Thursday.  If you have any issues, please contact Amir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPAM&lt;/strong&gt;: Follow the instructions for your platform at &lt;a href=&quot;http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Quick_Install.html&quot;&gt;http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Quick_Install.html&lt;/a&gt;.
OPAM requires OCaml so hopefully the relevant dependencies will kick in and
you'll get OCaml too (most likely version 3.12).  You can get a cup of
coffee while you wait. After installation, run &lt;code&gt;opam init&lt;/code&gt; to initialise OPAM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OCaml 4.01&lt;/strong&gt;: We actually need the latest version of OCaml but OPAM
makes this easy.  Just run the following (and get more coffee):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;opam update
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;opam switch 4.01.0
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;opam config env&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libraries&lt;/strong&gt;: For the workshop you will need to check that you have the
following installed: &lt;code&gt;libffi&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pcre&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pkg-config&lt;/code&gt;.  This will depend on
your platform so on a Mac with homebrew I would do
&lt;code&gt;brew install libffi pcre pkg-config&lt;/code&gt; or on Debian or Ubuntu
&lt;code&gt;apt-get install libffi-dev&lt;/code&gt;.  After this, two OCaml packages it's worth
installing in advance are &lt;code&gt;core&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;js_of_ocaml&lt;/code&gt; so simply run:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;opam install core js_of_ocaml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;OPAM will take care of the dependencies and the rest we can get on the day!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The real problem of humanity</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I heard this today.  It made me stop and think so I decided to look it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The real problem of humanity is the following:
we have paleolithic emotions; medieval institutions;
and god-like technology.
And it is terrifically dangerous,
and it is now approaching a point of crisis overall.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Feedback requested on the OCaml.org redesign</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a work-in-progress site at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml-redesign.github.io&quot;&gt;ocaml-redesign.github.io&lt;/a&gt;, where we've
been developing both the tools and design for the new ocaml.org pages.  This
allows us to test our tools and fix issues before we consider merging
changes upstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a more detailed post coming about all the design work to date and
the workflow we're using, but in the meantime, feedback on the following
areas would be most welcome.  Please leave feedback in the form of issues on
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocamllabs/sandbox-ocaml.org/issues&quot;&gt;ocaml.org sandbox repo&lt;/a&gt;.  You can also raise points on the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure&quot;&gt;infrastructure mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OCaml Logo&lt;/strong&gt; - There was some feedback on the last iteration of the
logo, especially regarding the font, so there are now several options to
consider.  Please look at the images on the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Draft-OCaml-Logos&quot;&gt;ocaml.org GitHub wiki&lt;/a&gt; and then leave your feedback on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocamllabs/sandbox-ocaml.org/issues/16&quot;&gt;issue #16 on the sandbox repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Site design&lt;/strong&gt; - Please do give feedback on the design and any glitches
you notice. Text on each of the new landing pages is still an initial draft
so comments and improvements there are also welcome (specifically: Home
Page, Learn, Documentation, Platform, Community). There are already a few
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocamllabs/sandbox-ocaml.org/issues&quot;&gt;known issues&lt;/a&gt;, so do
add your comments to those threads first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

                <title>I'm working on The Internet of *my* Things</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time I've been interested what the future holds in terms of how
we will interact with each other and our environments.  Back in the day,
these areas used to be called ubiquitous computing and home automation but
have since been subsumed by the (only slightly) catchier moniker of Internet
of Things (IoT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/mjwiacek/3718366706/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 10px&quot; src=&quot;/images/web/pizza-oven.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
A couple of my ideas involved controlling devices at home via SMS messages
(this was way before smart phones and 'apps' came along).  For example,
being able to set my VCR to record a show while I'm out* or pre-heat the
oven when I'm heading home with a frozen pizza&lt;sup&gt;&amp;dagger;&lt;/sup&gt;.  Of
course, if I were to implement these now I'd take a completely different
approach.  With all the advances we've made, the Internet of Things has huge
potential to change our lives the way the Internet itself did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if we take the last decade of the Internet and Web as an example of
how the IoT may play out it's actually not a pretty picture.  We're in the
age of the Internet behemoths, with huge centralised data silos containing
lots of our personal data.  We trust such services to secure our data but
&lt;a href=&quot;http://venturebeat.com/2012/08/01/dropbox-has-become-problem-child-of-cloud-security/&quot;&gt;repeated breaches&lt;/a&gt; undermine that trust. Sure, there is
some choice among providers but it's fast becoming a case of &quot;choose your
dictator&quot;.  Our information is trapped, interoperating is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/google-abandons-open-standards-instant-messaging&quot;&gt;becoming difficult&lt;/a&gt; and to top it off, these giants are
busy fighting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20130523150909464&quot;&gt;legal battles&lt;/a&gt; with each other instead of
out-competing.  Users just get caught in the cross-fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we extrapolate this to the Internet of Things then, ultimately, it'll
become a winner-take-all-my-data arrangement, with lock-ins to restrict me
from migrating.  Remember, we're talking about connecting more devices to
the Internet and giving almost ubiquitous access to our daily lives and
habits.  Trading more of our personal lives, from within our homes, with
increasingly faceless companies and for not very much in return, isn't
particularly appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/59937401@N07/5857192377/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:left; margin-right: 15px;&quot; src=&quot;/images/web/monopoly-house-die-dollar.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
If the IoT plays out this way, then we will effectively &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; the
Privacy Tax that we've &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; had to pay for our social networking tools.
In order to benefit from the world of connected devices, we have to adjust
(again) the notion of ownership.  I want this to be the Internet of &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt;
Things, so how do we make that happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To really achieve that, we need to have software infrastructure that
incorporates &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_Design&quot;&gt;Privacy by Design&lt;/a&gt;, so that an individual can regain the
ability to control their data and decide for themselves whom to share it
with. These infrastructure tools must also work in a distributed fashion, so
there's no requirement to ally yourself to any particular centralised
service. Of course, the tools themselves also have to be open-source, so
that developers can be reassured that the ground they're building their
products on won't be taken away from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year and a half, I've been exploring these ideas at the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk&quot;&gt;Cambridge Computer Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.  A lot of cutting edge work is being done
on the problems of &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org/connected-devices-and-signpost&quot;&gt;Identity and connectivity&lt;/a&gt; as well as the
operating systems for the future.  Infrastructure and tools are being shaped
that together form a new toolstack to make the creation and management of
decentralised networks easier&lt;sup&gt;&amp;Dagger;&lt;/sup&gt;.  There's a larger picture
emerging from this work and it's time to start talking more about it and
describing the pieces.  We're calling this open-source toolstack
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org&quot;&gt;Nymote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and there's a new site where you can read more about it and
keep up with news and releases.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org/blog/2013/introducing-nymote/&quot;&gt;introductory post&lt;/a&gt;
there describes more about the background and what we're working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be writing about this work both here and on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org/blog&quot;&gt;Nymote Blog&lt;/a&gt; and I'd
love to hear from others who are interested in this area -- please do
&lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;get in touch with me&lt;/a&gt; or leave a comment.  If you'd like to sign up
for updates by email, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://eepurl.com/mXYb1&quot;&gt;join the Nymote list here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;* Sky+ came out with this feature a few months after I started discussing it with people.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;dagger;&lt;/sup&gt; Yes, people told me this was insane and I'd burn my house down.  Luckily for my housemates, I never actually got around to implementing anything.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;Dagger;&lt;/sup&gt; This is somewhat ironic as decentralisation was one of the founding tenets of the Internet. We're just helping people get back to that.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Wireframe demos for OCaml.org</title>
                <description>&lt;h3&gt;Making mockups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, I've been working on various aspects of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org&quot;&gt;OCaml.org&lt;/a&gt; design project.  This covers things like the design, information architecture and how to incorporate new functionality.  One of the methods for thinking through these was to put together a bunch of wireframes using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.balsamiq.com&quot;&gt;Balsamiq&lt;/a&gt; and use these to express (and generate) ideas as well as get feedback quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven't used wireframes before, think of them as a slightly more advanced form of sketching things out on a whiteboard.  The best aspect is that it's far quicker, easier and &lt;em&gt;cheaper&lt;/em&gt; to iterate using wireframes than on an actual website.  As you'll see below, you can also convey a lot of information about how a site might work by showing people a clickable demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make this work public and I thought the best way would be to show you some screencasts of how the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org&quot;&gt;OCaml.org&lt;/a&gt; website might work and also make the demo available to all of you.  The three videos below cover three aspects of the site and I'd encourage you to go through them in order (about 16 minutes in total).  Apologies if my screen isn't particularly clear in the videos but you can visit the demo for yourself and see things in more detail (link and info on feedback at the end of this post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Video walkthroughs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who'd like to watch the videos back-to-back and scaled to fit your browser window, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/couchmode/album/2301640&quot;&gt;view the Vimeo album in 'couchmode'&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, individual videos are embedded below (total time 16m17s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Public wireframe demo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A demo you can interact with can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocaml.mybalsamiq.com/projects/public-demo/naked/0_home?key=b897ea86d8a8199c6e46b3295ddf630dfa33e5e1&quot;&gt;OCaml.org wireframe demo&lt;/a&gt; and image files for each page are available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Wireframes&quot;&gt;github ocaml.org wiki&lt;/a&gt;.  Please bear in mind the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everything that looks like it might be clickable actually is (and vice versa). There'll be a toggle on the bottom right of the browser window that will highlight what can be clicked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are parts of the site which are 'work in progress' and are marked as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The designs you see aren't necessarily final. Your feedback will help shape our decisions and the best way to provide it is via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure&quot;&gt;infrastructure mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                <title>OCaml - Installation and hello world</title>
                <description>

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;This post is part of a series where I'm trying to teach myself OCaml.&lt;br /&gt;
You might want to &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/thirty-days-of-ocaml/&quot;&gt;start at the beginning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's been a few days into my OCaml experience so this is a write-up of what I've come across so far.  I've spent more time reading background rather than getting stuck in so I've copied in some of the links that I've found interesting/useful at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are number of ways you can get OCaml on your machine.  The most obvious  would be to get the source via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/release.en.html&quot;&gt;release page&lt;/a&gt;, but you could also use something called &lt;a href=&quot;http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/index.html&quot;&gt;GODI&lt;/a&gt;, which apparently bundles a bunch of other stuff alongside the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't really want to install from source 'by hand' and I definitely don't need all the stuff that comes with GODI.  I happen to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; on my machine, so I checked to see if I can install that way.  Turns out I can, so that's what I ended up doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;brew install objective-caml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The current version of OCaml is 4.00.0 and you can check the version you have installed by typing &lt;code&gt;ocaml -version&lt;/code&gt; in your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware that Homebrew has it's own installation process and depends on Ruby.  To get Ruby, someone recommended that I install via &lt;a href=&quot;https://rvm.io/&quot;&gt;Ruby Version Manager&lt;/a&gt;.  To be able to do the above, you'll need to have the OSX developer tools installed, which means having &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/xcode/&quot;&gt;Xcode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program&quot;&gt;hello world&lt;/a&gt; programme working.  Since OCaml is a compiled language, that means writing the necessary source code into a file, compiling it and then executing it.  In this case I only need one line that prints 'hello world' to the screen and I'm taking it from INRIA's site (&lt;a href=&quot;http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/u3-ocaml/ocaml-steps.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello, world!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Take the one line above and save it in a file called &lt;code&gt;hello.ml&lt;/code&gt;.  Now we need to compile that file using the OCaml compiler.  At the command prompt, type the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ocamlc -o hello hello.ml
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;./hello
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Since I don't really understand the first line I should break it down. &lt;code&gt;ocamlc&lt;/code&gt; is the command to invoke the compiler, the option &lt;code&gt;-o hello&lt;/code&gt; means you want to name the output executable to be (in this case) 'hello' and the final argument is the source code file.  It's useful to look at the man page for &lt;code&gt;ocamlc&lt;/code&gt; to see what other options are available.  The second line executes the programme, which prints hello world to the screen with a line-break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also notice that I now have two other files in addition to the source, &lt;code&gt;hello.cmi&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hello.cmo&lt;/code&gt;.  According to the man page, these are the 'compiled interface' and 'compiled object code file' respectively.  I have no idea what that means but removing the files doesn't affect the executable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;OCaml 'toplevel'&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though OCaml is a compiled language, there's something called 'toplevel' that allows interactive use (more on &lt;a href=&quot;http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual023.html&quot;&gt;toplevel&lt;/a&gt;).  To enter this mode, you simply have to type &lt;code&gt;ocaml&lt;/code&gt; at the prompt so let's try running the above hello world program using toplevel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;$ ocaml
        OCaml version 4.00.0

# print_string &amp;quot;Hello, world!\n&amp;quot;;;
Hello, world!
- : unit = ()
# #quit;;
$ 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; prompt is the command line and the &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; prompt is where toplevel is awaiting a new line of input.  The input can span multiple lines and is terminated by &lt;code&gt;;;&lt;/code&gt; (as in the source code).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To exit toplevel, type &lt;code&gt;#quit;;&lt;/code&gt;.  It took me three attempts to get that right.  I haven't really played around with toplevel much and I think I'm likely to stick with source code and compiling until I'm a little more comfortable with the syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much where I am for the moment and everything so far has been straightforward.  Obviously, I should push myself a bit harder :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the material I found and have been looking over for the last couple of days.  Useful as background but I'd say I'm in danger of (semi-productive) procrastination if I'm not careful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00&quot;&gt;OCaml Manual&lt;/a&gt; (from INRIA)&lt;/li&gt;

                <title>Thirty Days of OCaml</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeremyandchanel/6131620285/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ocaml-30days/camel-bactrian-silhouette.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bactrian Camel Silhouette&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've set myself a challenge that over the next thirty days, I'll teach myself some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming&quot;&gt;functional programming&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml&quot;&gt;OCaml&lt;/a&gt;.  This will be my first experience of FP in addition to learning a new language so I expect it'll be quite challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I go along, I'll try and write regular posts -- hopefully one a day -- describing my experiences and frustrations as well as the questions that occur to me.  I suspect a number of the posts might be summaries to help me organise my understanding, especially where things seem unexpected.  For the times where I can formulate well-posed questions, I'll put them up in places like &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ocaml&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; as well as describing them here.  Either way, keeping some form of diary will be useful for me and maybe also for other folks who've considered trying out FP and OCaml in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I'm not completely new to programming but I would say I have any deep experience (especially compared to the folks I tend to hang out with). Just to give you a better picture, my coding experience so far has involved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some C/C++ with a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming&quot;&gt;OOP&lt;/a&gt; programming for a High Energy Physics simulation (during my undergrad - a long time ago so I've forgotten everything)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/&quot;&gt;Matlab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)&quot;&gt;Bash&lt;/a&gt; scripting for analysis of neuroimaging data (during my PhD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications&quot;&gt;VBA&lt;/a&gt; within MS Excel for analysing behavioural data (also during my PhD -- I really wish someone had pointed me to Python back then)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://learnpythonthehardway.org&quot;&gt;Learn Python the Hard Way&lt;/a&gt; (I keep dipping in and out of this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I tried to dump most of my old scripts -- at least those I could find -- into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amirmc/PhD_stuff&quot;&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt;, but I still haven't collated the Matlab bits.  You can judge my coding skills for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the 30 days, I'm hoping to have the ability to pick up and read other people's OCaml code and write basic stuff for myself.  I don't actually have a particular project in mind but I'm not going to let that be an excuse for &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll post again tomorrow with the mundane parts of how to get things installed and running on a Mac*.  Onward!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*Admittedly, I already did this some time ago but I want this series of posts to start right from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>I'm in San Francisco (and later NYC)</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Actually, I've been here for a while now and feeling (mostly) settled in.  I'm in the US for another couple of months, most of which will be in SF, with a short trip to Colorado and New York thrown in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I've met a bunch of folks from 'back home', people that they know, and a handful of new ones.  While I'm out here, I'm hoping to meet a lot more people who might be interested in the work we're doing in the Lab.  Specifically things related to Software Defined Networking, Identity and Functional Programming -- basically anything that overlaps with projects like &lt;a href=&quot;http://perscon.net/overview/signpost.html&quot;&gt;Signpost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openmirage.org/&quot;&gt;Mirage&lt;/a&gt; (if you happen to know anyone, bonus points for putting me in touch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also managed to get out of town, courtesy of friends-with-a-car, and saw the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/&quot;&gt;Monterey Aquarium&lt;/a&gt; (some pics below).  Not been hiking yet but will hopefully make it out of town again at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, SF is a very interesting place and I can see the draw for people to come here.  Although a lot of the companies are further south, there's much more 'stuff' happening here.  I'm looking forward to the next couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure where this came from but it's interesting (e.g I had no idea that Nestle did pet food nor that they had a stake in L'Oreal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a month ago I was at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tedxgranta.com/&quot;&gt;TEDx Granta&lt;/a&gt;.  The theme was Alive &amp;amp; Kicking and it was a good event with some really interesting speakers, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eben Upton, on the Raspberry Pi Foundation (pic 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merlin Crossingham, on Wallace &amp;amp; Gromit (pics 5&amp;amp;6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tim Minshall, on how engineers make the future (pic 9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Videos will be on the website at some point for those who want to catchup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also another TED event taking place in June. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tedxoxbridge.com/&quot;&gt;TEDx Oxbridge&lt;/a&gt;, organised by students from Oxford and Cambridge, will be on the theme of Unconventional Wisdom.  Not sure who the speakers are yet.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>More likely to die Dancing than Skydiving</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;From the infographic below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Odds of dying while skydiving in the US: 1 in 101,083&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Dance parties: 1 in 100,000 chance of dying&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonder what the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcpa.org.uk/&quot;&gt;BCPA&lt;/a&gt; would make of this, since they recklessly combine both Skydiving &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; parties on a regular basis (how extreme).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously though, this nicely depicts that many things have &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; odds than skydiving (although comparisons like this should be taken with a pinch of salt).  However, base jumping (which is not the same thing as skydiving) seems to be the most dangerous by far (1 in 60).&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Joining the Computer Lab Systems Group</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This was the post I &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to write all the way back in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've joined the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/netos/&quot;&gt;Systems Research Group&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;Cambridge Computer Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.  Much of the work here has a strong practical angle and people like to build useful things.  Several of the profs here have been involved in creating some prominent companies (one recent example is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xensource.com&quot;&gt;XenSource&lt;/a&gt;, which powers much of the public cloud - bought by Citrix).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work in the lab is related to &lt;a href=&quot;http://perscon.net/&quot;&gt;Personal Containers&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to give users access and control over their lifelong digital footprint.  It's part of a wider research program funded by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.horizon.ac.uk/Horizon-Research&quot;&gt;Horizon Digital Economy Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, which tackles topics ranging from energy efficiency to &quot;Death 2.0&quot; (that might sound odd but what &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; happens to your online identity/ies when you die? What &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; happen? How?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I worked on was a paper with several other folks in the lab, which is currently being presented at a conference.  It's about infrastructure to infer the carbon footprint of employees' daily commute by analysing high resolution geolocation data from their smartphones.  Obviously, this must be done in a privacy-sensitive manner, which is what the paper discusses.  Once it's published in the conference proceedings I'll add a link to it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also been writing a bit on the Personal Conatainer's blog about privacy and personal data.  The posts there will be reposted here too, over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, here are some random pics from the lab.  The second pic will make more sense if you've seen the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/242/&quot;&gt;xkcd comic&lt;/a&gt; it's based on.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>I moved my site to GitHub Pages</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Yet again, it's been several months since my last post (it's almost a habit now).  This isn't intended to be another catchup post, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this post is that I've moved my site (&lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com&quot;&gt;amirchaudhry.com&lt;/a&gt;) to &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I'm using my own domain, this is unlikely to affect anyone but I've copied this post into both the new GitHub site and old Posterous site just in case.  If you're reading this via &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirmc.posterous.com&quot;&gt;my Posterous site&lt;/a&gt; (presumably through the share/follow features there), then it'll be the last post to go up there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still a bunch of things that are bit broken in the new place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No tweet/sharing buttons*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tags don't sort properly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search doesn't work well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSS/Atom feed is probably a mess&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syntax highlighting isn't working**&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Moving from Posterous to GitHub Pages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of moving to GitHub was a useful experience.  Here are the steps I ended up taking before I pointed the domain to the new site. Overall, I'm really glad that my posts aren't tied up in someone else's platform anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Getting set up with GitHub Pages&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; and the default &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/&quot;&gt;bootstrap theme&lt;/a&gt;. It was &lt;em&gt;ridiculously&lt;/em&gt; quick and easy to get a basic site up and start playing around.  The first thing I did was try to re-create structure of my old site and then worry about how it looked.  I'd never dealt with CSS before so this was always going to take a while. For example, it took me &lt;em&gt;ages&lt;/em&gt; to figure out why items kept shifting between pages. Turns out I needed the following line in my style file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;overflow-y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;scroll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Although dealing with the CSS took a while, Bootstrap made it really easy to copy/paste/edit the bits I wanted to change.  The nav section was a pain to sort out.  It took a few weeks to get to this point but you're looking at a bootstrap site, which looks nothing like bootstrap (win!). It's likely that I'll keep tweaking things but I'm not expecting to do anything major.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Migrating the posts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn't an easy way to migrate directly from Posterous to GitHub. There are scripts available but either through bad-luck or ineptitude, I couldn't get them to work.  A guy called &lt;a href=&quot;http://jazzychad.net/&quot;&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt; recently created &lt;a href=&quot;http://exportmyposts.com&quot;&gt;Export My Posts&lt;/a&gt;, which pulled out all my content in html format (phew!).  I really didn't want to deal with learning an API or parsing an xml file, so I'm glad he put this together.  It works extremely well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step was to run all the html posts through &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc&quot;&gt;pandoc&lt;/a&gt; to convert them to markdown. I wrote a fairly trivial shell script to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; -e &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Files to convert to md? &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt; -a allfiles
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#args=(&amp;quot;$@&amp;quot;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for &lt;/span&gt;file in &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;allfiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[*]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;   %s\n&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$file&lt;/span&gt;
    pandoc -o ./convert/&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$file&lt;/span&gt;.md &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then came the slow process of checking each file, removing the left-over html, adding the appropriate headers, dealing with image galleries etc.  Part of this could have been automated but I don't have that many posts so I went through them manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all that was done, I simply had to switch the domain over and everything was fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to keep a local copy of content. Of course, this is now solved but even before-hand I would write and save things locally before sending them up. The problem was that I'd always have to tweak something or edit a typo and &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; changes happened on the site (never on my local copy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having existing things I can dig into and copy from (i.e. bootstrap) really speeds up my learning. I don't think I could have gotten this far this quickly without such resources.  If you look at the code itself it's probably a mess, but it's &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scripting things will help. Quickly creating image galleries is the next thing I need to figure out. The process is obvious to me now (since I did parts of it by hand) but I have to automate it using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imagemagick.org&quot;&gt;ImageMagick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'm quite pleased with myself.  I've gone from knowing nothing about CSS, static sites, and bootstrap to being vaguely (in)competent. Rock on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*Though I'll probably use something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addthis.com&quot;&gt;AddThis&lt;/a&gt;. ... Edit: Ok, so at the time of writing, I didn't have the buttons but by the time of publishing I'd figured it out :)&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;**Yup, managed to fix that too :)&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Long overdue catchup post</title>
                <description>

&lt;h3&gt;aka 'highlights of the last few months'&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been quite a while since I posted anything and it's time I did.  The last few months have been pretty busy so I thought I'd write some notes about the main items in one post and then we can pretend that I'm current again.  I'm well aware that the sheer size of this post means it's unlikely to be read fully by most people.  There are some pics so perhaps that might be enough to hold your interest :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later this week, I'll write a separate post about the things I'm working on now and I'll try to keep more up to date from then onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the following covers October to December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Silicon Valley comes to the UK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.svc2uk.com&quot;&gt;SVc2UK&lt;/a&gt; was a 5/6 day conference with events taking place in Cambridge and London.  The aim is to introduce students from universities to high-profile folks from the Valley and inspire the students to consider startups as a career path (either by founding or joining them).  I was involved in this conference back in 2009 and decided to join the the new team for the 2011 events.  This year the conference was preceded by a several 'Appathons' (read: hackathons), which took place at 6 Universities, including Cambridge.  You can find out more about the Appathon and the conference via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.svc2uk.com&quot;&gt;svc2uk.com&lt;/a&gt; but here are some short notes and some pics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;-- Cambridge Appathon --&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hackathons were 2-day events aimed at students and the theme was open government data.  I ran the Cambridge event on behalf of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cue.org.uk&quot;&gt;Cambridge University Entrepreneurs&lt;/a&gt; and we had about 80 people taking part over the course of the weekend.  Representatives from Google, Facebook, Apple and the Technology Strategy Board were present to advise the student teams and folks from the local tech community also got involved.  At the end of the weekend, we awarded Amazon Kindles to three winning teams (as decided by audience vote) and everyone was encouraged to enter the national competition too.  One of the Cambridge teams also won the national prize (a trip to SV).  Yeay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the sheer amount of brain-ache involved, I could (should?) write a separate post on how to run a hackathon.  Maybe I'll get around to it at some point but in the meantime, here's the team that actually pulled this together: &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/~mabotinc/index.html&quot;&gt;Matko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~arb33/&quot;&gt;Alistair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~acr31/&quot;&gt;Andy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benfwirtz&quot;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/ivanmazour&quot;&gt;Ivan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/simofeja&quot;&gt;Simona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saardrimer.com/&quot;&gt;Saar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/roger-coulston/26/598/7a1&quot;&gt;Roger&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm also especially grateful to the sponsors/supporters of the event: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.red-gate.com/&quot;&gt;Red Gate Software&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cocoacontrols.com/&quot;&gt;Cocoa Controls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/106738482735452735039/posts&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt; (at Google), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.svc2uk.com&quot;&gt;SVc2UK&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;Cambridge Computer Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; (who hosted us for a weekend).  Below are some pictures of the event itself and the national awards ceremony at Downing Street.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;-- SVc2C Conference --&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the main part of the conference and the guests from the Valley were in Cambridge for two days.  In that time, they took part in a pretty large number of events and hopefully met a lot of interesting students.  If you're interested in the list of guests, you can check them out via the link on the conference website (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.svc2uk.com&quot;&gt;svc2uk.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find videos of this year's sessions on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/user5407037&quot;&gt;Vimeo account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Stanford online courses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did all three of the inaugural classes. Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Databases ... and I enjoyed them in that order.  The following is a short summary/review of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ml-class.org/&quot;&gt;ML-Class&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was fantastic since you had to write actual scripts and I really looked forward to both the videos and exercises every week.  At times, the exercises felt a bit contrived (one line of code in a file) but there were occasions where I had to really think properly to &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; that one line.  Once you got the hang of matrix multiplication the exercises got easier.  The scores don't really mean anything since you could repeat the questions until you got a perfect score. At some point, I'll go back over the iTunes U content from the profs 2008 class.  It has more theory/maths and covers reinforcement learning, which the applied course didn't.  You can find my 'programming' exercises &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amirmc/ai-ml-classes&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ai-class.com/&quot;&gt;AI-Class&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was a very different course and it didn't seem as 'slick' as the ML class but I learnt &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more maths, specifically about probability.  Since I was terrible at probability at school, I really wanted to get a better handle on it and this class really made me work.  I have pages and pages of calculations for some of the in-class questions and I hope I can retain what I've learnt.  At times there was only a cursory overview of a topic before moving on but I should have expected that from an &quot;Intro to...&quot; course.  This was the only class with &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; graded homeworks and exams. Overall, I was in the 'top 25%' according the statement I got (overall mark was 95%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.db-class.org&quot;&gt;DB-Class&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was the one I least understood but the one I originally thought I was going to stick with.  Within the first few lectures, I knew I was going to find it tough.  Relational Algebra made no sense to me and the videos seemed to cover each example once and move on to something else.  Since I didn't have enough time to find additional resources, I ended up barely following along and basically flunked the course.  There was a mid-term and final exam and the homeworks could be repeated until you got a perfect score (but I ended up not bothering).  No idea what score I got but you needed &gt;50% to get a statement and I didn't get one :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I was very impressed by the dedication and effort the profs and the teams working with them put into the courses.  Although the profs were the folks centre stage, there were a group of largely unsung heroes who kept things running, put together exercises and enabled everything to happen.  This method of learning is really going to take off and if people can figure out how to deal with proper certification, then it might even challenge the notion of going to University.  There have been a slew of new courses available and I think I'll try two more if I can fit them in (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pgm-class.org/&quot;&gt;Probabilistic Graphical Models&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.modelthinker-class.org/&quot;&gt;Model Thinking&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Learning to code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also been trying to keep up with learning Python via &lt;a href=&quot;http://learnpythonthehardway.org/&quot;&gt;LPtHW&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amirmc/TheHardWay&quot;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; for progress).   I'd describe myself as chugging along and I'm glad that I'm not finding anything too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trickiest part is finding ways to actually fit some coding into things I need done.  Since I finished analysing my PhD data, I've not had the need to write scripts or manipulate data in any substantive way and I don't fancy re-writing any of my old stuff (NB I also tried to collate all of that and added it to GitHub too).  I'm sure I can find something worth doing and I suspect it might involve Django sooner than I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also signed up to Code Academy's 'Code Year' but I've not opened any of their emails yet (and I suspect I won't have time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/web/lpthwbook.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Learn Python the Hard Way&quot; alt=&quot;LPtHW&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Events and occasional startup stuff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always there have been a bunch of events and startup-related items in the last few months.  Normally I wouldn't bother mentioning these but I'm in a list-y mood.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;... and finally&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to get this done in October.  Took a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great graphic. I'm surprised to see Vitamins A &amp;amp; E so far down the list though.&lt;/p&gt;

A possible reason that the &quot;tangible health benefits&quot; of Vitamins A &amp;amp; E is low is that a &quot;healthy diet&quot; (mentioned at the top of the graphic) already includes enough of those nutrients, and consuming extra vitamins above the required level does not confer extra health benefits. Also: hello! How do? ;-) &lt;/p&gt;

                <title>My thoughts on the Seedsummit Term Sheet</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/web/seedsummit-termsheet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Affärsbilder by Dan Eriksson on Flickr&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, &lt;a href=&quot;http://seedsummit.org&quot;&gt;Seedsummit&lt;/a&gt; released a Term
Sheet intended to be (or become) standard across Europe for early stage
investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been several days since the announcement and so far I haven’t seen
much in-depth commentary on it (other than acknowledging its existence
and how difficult it must have been to achieve consensus). That might be
because the announcement seemed to come as a surprise, so perhaps folks
haven’t had a chance to digest it yet. Or maybe nobody cares?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/pda/2011/jul/06/startups-terms-seed&quot;&gt;One post from the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; offered some criticism, but beyond that it’s all been a bit quiet. Since no-one else has posted any thoughts, I thought I’d go through the document and offer my opinions. I’ve put the notes in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/review-of-the-seedsummit-term-sheet&quot;&gt;more comprehensive post&lt;/a&gt; and summarised the main points here (mostly because going through a legal document is a little bit dreary).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Main comments on Seedsummit term sheet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few of things that founders should be careful of. First is
the liquidation preference, where founders should be getting the
non-participating option (Option 1). Second is vesting, since founders
probably want to adjust the values described. Third is how the option
pool is set up (before/after the funding). Finally, the anti-dilution
provisions don’t seem to provide any useful information so founders
should check this carefully if they’re presented with it. For more
detail on any of these points, see the relevant section in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/review-of-the-seedsummit-term-sheet&quot;&gt;detailed
review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall impression I got was that these are documents for &lt;strong&gt;dealing
with VCs&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(edit: It seems an additional note was added to the download
page to this effect)&lt;/em&gt;. Unsurprising since it was put together by 21 VC
firms from across Europe. Surprising because I’m guessing no Angel
investors were involved, despite the term sheet being advertised for
‘early stage’ financing. Since Seedsummit is trying to build a network
of european investors (and credit to them for that), I did find it a
little odd that there didn’t seem to be any Angels listed as helping to
create this document. Perhaps it’s because the Angels aren’t investing
on a pan-european basis? I’d love to see a Series A term sheet for
comparison and my gut feel is that the Seedsummit document has a lot
more in common with Series A than with Angel docs. This does beg the
question, what does ‘seed’ actually mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What does &lt;em&gt;seed&lt;/em&gt; mean?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, I set up and ran the first iteration of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.springboard.com&quot;&gt;Springboard&lt;/a&gt; (a seed accelerator). We were
helping early-stage teams to get a product out the door and to start
getting feedback from users (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/venturehacks/customer-development-methodology-presentation&quot;&gt;customer development&lt;/a&gt;).
When teams came out of the programme, I considered them ‘seed-stage’,
i.e likely to be ready for seed investment, wherever that may come from.
Ideally, the team would have a version of the product that was being
used by early adopters. The team would be adapting that product based on
feedback, although they would likely have little/no revenue. That
basically sums up what I picture in my head when I think of
‘seed-stage’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last week I’ve met several VCs from different firms and asked
them directly what &lt;em&gt;seed&lt;/em&gt; means to them. For each of them, seed-stage
investing involves companies that have a product, customers and
revenues. This was pretty much the case for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the VCs I spoke to. I
wish I’d probed for more detail as to what kind of revenue/customer
numbers they expect but never mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, despite using the same language, there’s obviously a gap
between the above viewpoints. I’m not suggesting either of them is right
or wrong but I think it’s important to point out such differences,
especially in the light of the new ‘standard’ term sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What does this term sheet mean for founders?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In brief, founders should do their homework. In going through this
document, I spent quite a while researching and there’s actually a lot
of information out there about what the terms mean and the impact they
might have. As we now have a European VC term sheet in the open it’ll
make comparisons with US VCs a lot easier. Any major disparities will
quickly be picked on by the popular startups who might go elsewhere to
raise money. Indeed, the real test will be whether or not a ‘hot’ new
startup uses these terms and as they stand, I doubt that will be the
case. Founders will still need lawyers and VCs will still be willing to
negotiate terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not quite at the point-and-click stage for early stage financing
but with more and more information being put into the open, it does
become easier for startups to make better informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t already, you can go check my &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/journal/review-of-the-seedsummit-term-sheet&quot;&gt;review of the Seedsummit terms&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Review of the Seedsummit Term Sheet</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/my-thoughts-on-the-seedsummit-term-sheet&quot;&gt;summary post&lt;/a&gt; (above) before reading this one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary: Last week, &lt;a href=&quot;http://seedsummit.org&quot;&gt;Seedsummit&lt;/a&gt; released a Term
Sheet intended to be (or become) standard across Europe for early stage
investment. To achieve this, 21 European VC firms convened and agreed on
a ‘standard’ set of terms. The aim of producing this document is to make
“… seed funding easier to access, better to understand, and fair for all
parties”. If you want to, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seedcamp.com/docs/seedsummit_general_termsheet_v1p.doc&quot;&gt;download the general term sheet&lt;/a&gt;
for yourself. I’ll go through this document below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Things to note&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get into the document itself, there are a few things I should
point out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most important is that &lt;strong&gt;I Am Not A Lawyer&lt;/strong&gt;. Anyone dealing
with &lt;em&gt;legal docs&lt;/em&gt; should obviously get &lt;em&gt;legal advice&lt;/em&gt;. However,
since this term sheet is meant to be “reader-friendly” (as
SeedSummit says), I’d hope that someone like myself should be able
to understand and interpret it to some degree. If not, one of the
benefits of this document diminishes since I still need a lawyer to
translate it for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m only reviewing the general term sheet, not the EIS specific
sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve read typical angel investment docs since I’ve led one angel
investment before (for someone else). Hence my point of view is
likely to be influenced by that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve never seen a term sheet from a VC so I can’t make any specific
comparisons between the new SeedSummit sheet or a prior VC term
sheet (though I’d like to).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously, everything you read is here is just my opinion. Whether
you agree or disagree, I just want to see some discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About Seedsummit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realised I know very little about Seedsummit itself so I looked around
their website and also for other links via Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few words, SeedSummit is Europe’s answer to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://angel.co/&quot;&gt;AngelList&lt;/a&gt;. More specifically, it’s SeedCamp’s answer
to AngelList (it’s run by the same people rather than independently). It
seems there are about 120-ish investors (assuming all profiles are
visible) and the investment range is from 10k to 500k EUR (which is the
kind of range I consider to be ‘seed’). Randomly clicking through the
profiles, I see that the majority of them say “I am investing: My own
money”. At first, I took that to mean there were more Angels on the
platform but looking closer I noticed that some of those profiles are of
Partners in VC funds. Although these folks have ‘skin in the game’ I
expect they only invest via their funds so it would have been more
appropriate to say “Money from a fund”. In any case, this made it more
tricky to guess at the ratio between Angels and VCs on Seedsummit, so I
gave up trying. If anyone else knows the answer, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Comments on the Seedsummit Term Sheet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll go through this term by term and note my comments so you can follow
along with the document. I’ll skip the stuff that doesn’t warrant much
discussion (e.g Company, Founders, etc). Since this document was based
on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seriesseed.com/&quot;&gt;Series Seed&lt;/a&gt; documents from the US,
I’ll also make a quick comparison between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Structure of financing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/114.asp&quot;&gt;pre-money&lt;/a&gt;
valuation includes the employee share option pool, which effectively
dilutes the founders a little more than they would otherwise have
expected. There’s a pretty good post by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/11/valuation-and-option-pool.html&quot;&gt;Fred Wilson on valuations and option pools&lt;/a&gt;
and I’d recommend people read that for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Type of security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This basically says that the new shares have preferential rights (i.e
they are not common stock).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Liquidation preferences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two options here and both state “… one times the original
purchase price …”, in other words it’s the same amount of money the
investor put in. Had this been anything other than ‘one’ it would be
cause for concern. The main difference between the two options is
whether the investor is &lt;em&gt;non-participating&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;fully-participating&lt;/em&gt;
which are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Non-participating&lt;/em&gt; means that the investor can do one of two things
when there’s a ‘liquidity event’ (e.g acquisition). They can either make
sure they get their money back (i.e one times the purchase price), with
any left over being divided amongst the other shareholders. Or they can
choose to get an amount in proportion to the shares they hold. They will
take whichever returns the most money. Obviously, both the founder and
investor want the sale to be as large as possible so both will be aiming
for the latter case. In the case where the exit isn’t quite what the
investor imagined, then they’ll try and get their money back. It seems
there is an example of this in practice when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/08/heres-why-you-need-a-liquidation-preference.html&quot;&gt;Fred wrote about Slide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fully-participating&lt;/em&gt; means the investor gets to do &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; of the
above. They will get their money out first and then will &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; take a
share of any left over money (sometimes referred to as
‘double-dipping’). This is definitely the less founder-friendly option
and I expect founders would not accept it (assuming they have enough
bargaining power to push back). It does seem a little odd to me that
this is listed as an option in an early stage term sheet, especially
since terms usually get carried forward into subsequent funding rounds.
For an example of how liquidation preferences can affect the way money
gets distributed, you can read &lt;a href=&quot;http://venturebeat.com/2010/08/16/beware-the-trappings-of-liquidation-preference/&quot;&gt;VentureBeat on liquidation preferences&lt;/a&gt;
(scroll down to the example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Anti-dilution provisions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This term, which is indicated as optional, dictates what happens if a
subsequent round of funding occurs at a lower valuation than the current
one. Except it doesn’t. Those deceptive square brackets could hold a
range of scary sounding words and in some cases you might even find
equations in there. Since there’s no suggested text here, I don’t have
much to say. Feel free to google and you’ll find some variations on what
could end up in here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Important Decisions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A list of things you can’t do without the investor’s consent. The
options here basically whether the list is written in the terms or
referred to in an appendix. From the suggested list, there isn’t
anything I haven’t seen before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that might be &lt;em&gt;missing&lt;/em&gt; is the proportion of shares that must
be maintained by these investors to maintain this right. As it stands,
the investor could hold any amount of shares and still maintain the
right (e.g they could hold less than 5% and still block a sale of the
company even if the other 95+% agreed to it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pre-emption, Right of first-refusal and Co-sale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen most of this before but there are a couple of things I don’t
understand. Firstly, for pre-emption, “The Investors my assign this
right to another member of their fund group”. I have no idea what this
means since I can’t figure what ‘fund group’ is being referred to.
Secondly, for the Right of first-refusal, I’m not sure what “…transfers
by Investors to affiliated funds” means either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Drag Along&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important point here is that &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; a majority of the Preference
shares &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; of the Ordinary shares is required to enact it. Had it only
been a majority of Preference shares then it would be drastically
one-sided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Restrictive Covenants and Founders Undertakings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other documents come into play here, for example the employment
contracts. An interesting point is that the founders shouldn’t work on
anything else during their ‘business time’, which mean any side projects
might need permission from the investors. It’s reasonable to expect
founders to commit themselves to the business but they would need to
check the employment contract to make sure there isn’t anything
untoward. The last sentence referring to immediate dismissal for cause
seems a little harsh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Founder Shares&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the shares held by founders would be subject to &lt;em&gt;reverse
vesting&lt;/em&gt;. In effect, whatever shares you thought you ‘owned’, you don’t
really have anymore. Reverse vesting means that although you have your
shares the company will repurchase them from you (at practically no
cost) if you leave or are fired. That ‘right-to-repurchase’ diminishes
over time. This doesn’t sound like a good deal for the founders but it’s
understandable that the investor wants to keep the founders committed to
the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting part are the suggested figures. 25% of the founder
shares vest after a year and the rest on a monthly basis over another
two years. This seems a bit excessive to me. Firstly, I don’t see any
reason why more of the shares can’t vest immediately and the rest on a
monthly basis thereafter. Secondly, I think a three year time frame is
quite long and although I’ve seen it for employee options it doesn’t
seem appropriate for founders at an early stage. (edit to add: I’ve
heard from friends in San Francisco that four year vesting with a one
year cliff is pretty standard out there)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the kinds of startups I’ve dealt with, I’m generally of the opinion
that if a founder leaves, then the company is effectively over.
Provisions for clawing back shares, like the one one here, seem largely
pointless to me. In any case, I think founders will have to look
carefully at what the vesting looks like and see if it works for them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Expenses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 1 just plain sucks. I find it slightly ridiculous that the
investor expects the company to pay for their legal fees and the amount
isn’t even capped. Option 2 is slightly better in that everyone pays
their own fees but it also includes a caveat that if the founders decide
to withdraw, then they’ll have to pay the investor’s legal fees to date.
That would seem fair enough but notice there’s no caveat for the case
where the &lt;em&gt;investor&lt;/em&gt; decides to change their mind. I’d certainly push
for that to be added too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Brief comparison with Series Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Seedsummit term sheet is itself based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seriesseed.com/&quot;&gt;Series Seed&lt;/a&gt; documents so I thought it would make
sense to do a quick comparison between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a handful of things I noticed which were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Series seed only mentions a non-participating liquidation preference
(Seedsummit includes an option for fully participating)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Series Seed document, the investor’s legal expenses are paid
for by the company but they’re capped ($10,000).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Series Seed’s founder vesting is over 4 years (but gives no
suggestions).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No anti-dilution provisions in Series Seed term sheet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you got this far then congratulations on your patience!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Did Google+ Hangout just kill Skype?</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/singles//google-plus.png&quot; alt=&quot;google-plus&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disclaimer: I still haven't tried Hangout, not enough people in my
circles yet.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skype has been great for conference calls and video calls but it's
nearly always been a hassle with more than 2 people. It's analogous to
the way in which phones work i.e great when only two people need to talk
but confusing to set up if there are more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it's different, Hangout might obviate the need to use Skype
video again. Having multiple people, with cameras, all in one 'room' and
effectively with one-click sounds fantastic. Of course, I haven't tried
it yet but I can imagine not needing to use Skype video again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skype will still have it's place (for now) since I find it useful to see
who's online and ask quick questions via IM. However, even that benefit
might disappear in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm curious to know what other people think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I've been busy for the last couple of days. Last night was the
CUE Grand Finale and tonight was the CUTEC conference and dinner. Both
were fabulous and I guess I should write about them soon (It's been a
while since I actually posted new stuff here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the damage limitation begin :-P&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I just spent the afternoon &lt;del&gt;playing&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;doing valuable research&lt;/em&gt; with Lego.
The pics above show my amazing creation but they don't do justice to the
complexity of it. I really didn't think I'd need the instructions but I
was so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was actually part of a research study that will be done with 4-5
year old children. Essentially, the kids will be asked to follow
instructions to build objects and the researchers are interested in the
self-regulatory processes during constructive play ... woosh ... Me play
with Lego. Me happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the bus above is considered too complex, which doesn't
surprise me since it took me a few hours to put it together. Most of
that time was spent rummaging around in the box for the right parts
(that's part of the study design). I didn't help myself by deciding part
way through that I wanted it to be a right-hand drive bus instead of the
left-hand drive that the instructions described (you might be able to
spot the difference between pics 2 and 3). That was fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lego itself is pretty interesting and there are some really strict
tolerances required in its manufacture. If you've ever played with Lego,
consider the following: the pieces are held together only by friction,
yet you can create and dismantle fairly large and robust objects; if you
build a wall of Lego, the plane of that wall is pretty smooth (no
protruding bricks). If you're manufacturing millions of these little
things, you can only achieve that with some damn precise engineering.
Apparently the moulds are made within a tolerance of 2 micrometers. For
comparison, the width of a human hair ranges from 17-180 micrometers.
It's even more impressive when you consider that bricks from 1958 are
still compatible with bricks made today.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Richard Stallman on Free Software and your Freedom (lecture)</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Lecture at Cambridge Computer Lab on 1 March 2011 - Sponsored by
Software East (@markdalgarno)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[pls excuse the typos &amp;amp; poor grammar. I'm typing this on the fly and
unlikely to edit it before posting. Caveat emptor]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[edit: It was a long talk and I missed some chunks. Overall, he spoke
for just over 90mins. Longer than I was expecting]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Richard Stallman launched the development of the GNU operating system (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org&quot;&gt;www.gnu.org&lt;/a&gt;) in 1984. GNU is free software: everyone has the freedom to copy it and redistribute it, as well as to make changes either large or small. The GNU/Linux system, basically the GNU operating system with Linux added, is used on tens of millions of computers today. Stallman has received the ACM Grace Hopper Award, a MacArthur Foundation fellowship, the Electrical Frontier Foundation's Pioneer Award, and the Takeda Award for Social/Economic Betterment, as well as several honorary doctorates. &lt;br /&gt;
[taken from: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theiet.org/local/emea/europe/switzerland/stallman-2010.cfm&quot;&gt;http://www.theiet.org/local/emea/europe/switzerland/stallman-2010.cfm&lt;/a&gt; see his website at stallman.org]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stallman enters room and hush descends immediately. Cue joke about slides and &quot;definitely not PowerPoint&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is free software? It sw that respects your freedom. Think of free speech not free beer. A non free sw is digital colonization. It acts to divide and conquer people&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A program is free if you have 4 freedoms &lt;br /&gt;
0 - To run it as you wish &lt;br /&gt;
1 - Have source to edit to run as you wish &lt;br /&gt;
2 - To share &amp;amp; distribute &amp;amp; help others, as you wish &lt;br /&gt;
3 - To distribute modified, copies if you wish&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If sw does not obey these then it's unethical. Notice that these are not
about the technical issues. The difference is an ethical, social and
political distinction. The use of propriety sw is a social problem and
we should aim to eliminate the problem. ie eliminate propriety sw. Goal
of free sw is to make all sw free so that users are free. If you use a
program without freedom 2 then you end up in a moral dilemma. If someone
says &quot;Hey, great sw. Can I get a copy?&quot;. In this case you should choose
lesser of two evils, which is to violate the license and give your
friend a copy. Being the lesser evil doesn't mean it's good though. When
you've fully studied this dilemma what should you do? Option 1: don't
have any friends! That what the proprietary debs would have you do.
Option 2: don't have that sw in the first place so you don't end up in
the dilemma in the first place. Note on Piracy: They attack ships. With
arms. Freedom 0 - Essential so you can control your computing. No one
else should have that control. Only you. There are proprietary programs
that have licenses that restrict your freedom of speech (ie website
software that means you cannot publish stuff disparaging to sw vendor)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freedom 1 - Being a victim of malicious sw is something that ppl are
subject to all the time. For example back-doors, DRM, spyware,
handcuffs. The sw is not there to serve you but is actually a prison
guard. Eg in MSFT sw can install stuff on pc w/out user consent or
knowledge. Once windows has installed then it's no longer your machine.
Apple is no better. They've even stolen the ability to install apps.
They don't even agree w free sw. Also a back-door by which Apple can
delete sw installed on users machine. Even apps exist that detect
Jailbreak and refuse to operate. All these are Malware. Products
include: Apple iMoan, Apple iBad, Amazon Swindle - &quot;Kindle was conceived
to burn books.&quot; (riffs on Amazon taking books off devices etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if devs of proprietary sw are good, they're human and make errors.
ie bugs. Without freedom 1 you are a prisoner. Freedom 1 isn't enough.
There too much sw and plenty of non-devs cannot edit it. That's why we
need Freedom 3. To contribute to your community and spread benefits.
Without this freedom what a waste it would be for people to write
changes over and over. Every user can take part in Freedom 0 and 2 since
it doesn't require any programming knowledge. Freedom 1 and 3 allow
those who can to make improvements. With free software. Support is a
free-market since everyone can study the code and master it. Hence
people can get better support. Since support for proprietary sw is a
monopoly, the support sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four freedoms together give us democracy. These are sufficient for
people to have control over the sw. Without these the sw controls the
ppl. Launched free software foundation in 1983. All operating systems
were proprietary hence ppl immediately lost freedom when they had to
install an OS. This was an injustice. As an OS developer, he could write
the OS and then legally make it free. At the time, the free sw movement
had no enemies at the time. Mostly because ppl thought the job was so
big that it couldn't get done. Following the basic design of UNIX made
sense. Then I gave it a name which was a joke. [digs in bag]. GNU = Gnu
Not Unix. (riffs on the name and pronunciation). History of Linux.
Aside: What is a free sw license? Why do we need them? &lt;br /&gt;
Copyright law automatically limits anything that's written so you have
to explicitly grant the four freedoms. Even then there are distinctions.
Eg copy-left licenses and non copy-left licenses. Specifically, user has
to pass on the freedoms that have been passed on to him (copy-left).
Torvalds made the Linux Kernel free under the GNU license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name matters. Linux does not have the same views on 'free' as GNU.
Yet people using Linux think that most of the ideas came from Torvalds
rather than GNU. Debate on Human Rights has continued for centuries. Yet
the debate on free/proprietary sw has only gone on for about 20yrs.
Therefore the debate on what human rights are applicable to sw have only
involved the devs, who obviously have said &quot;none&quot;. Another problem. Now
ppl have another term: Open-Source. The ideas that surround this didn't
include the ethical aspects of 'free'. Easy to lose freedom if you don't
fight for it. There are now distros that contain proprietary sw and are
no longer free. Free distros can be found at gnu.org/distros. Why did
all this happen? &lt;br /&gt;
Because the idea of freedom wasn't important to people. They didn't
appreciate it. We have to teach ppl to value freedom and demand it. Our
greatest scarcity in FSF is not ppl to write sw but ppl to fight for the
idea of freedoms. Freedom is now different since JavaScript in browsers
means that things get installed in browser without your knowledge.
'Like' buttons even track ppl that don't use Facebook. Ppl need to be
educated. Even SaaS is becoming pervasive and is worse than proprietary
since the data goes elsewhere. There's no remedy for this, other than
not to use it. Only a minority of things like this but need to be aware
(eg GoogleDocs). Free software and Education &lt;br /&gt;
Schools must only teach free software. It's cheaper (but should be
considered secondary benefit). Free stuff from proprietary vendors is
simply a drug to get them hooked. Only free sw gives ppl the opportunity
to learn from code of large Programs. Even deeper reason though. For
goodwill and the moral imperative of sharing knowledge. Every school
from nursery to university must practice this. The issue should always
be an ethical one. Biggest obstacle to free sw is social inertia.

                <title>Session 4: Using audience insight to drive product success (BBC Case Study) #pcampldn</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Nic Newman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story of how they got it wrong and then put it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History: 2yrs ago, Weather site was pretty dated and had grand ambitions to update site.
 - Editorially led site
 - No product manager
 - No audience research plan
 - Drew wrong conclusions from research they did do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[video]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product took over a year to get out. BBC recorded thousands of complaints. Within 2-3 months it was re-launched, solving most of the problems. Site retested in beta with people who complained the last time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In original version did lots of focus groups and used this to decide what to do. eg ppl said they wanted everything on one page, so they did (without checking that it was right). Second thing was beta test was on folks that were weather nuts so they wanted all the detail. Public wanted simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For version 2, checked people's complaints and coded them so that there was a top ten list of things people didn't like. Then went back out to focus groups. Found people who were really angry and tried to work with these people to improve. Pressure from above (director general et al) meant quick wins were important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta test 2, tested on 1300 people and survey on their views in comparison with old weather site. Some quantitative data made a big difference when talking to DG about whether new site is going to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key learnings:
 - Have audience insight plan a
 - Qualitative followed by quantitative test is key
 - Make it iterative ... Audience research, usability and dev going concurrently
 - Regular testing to ensure that NetPromoter detractors and promoters both accept changes
 - Audience insights to inform communication plans of changes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of quantitative measures? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys and click-tracking. Eg of 1300 people, how many get to the forecast page and how many personalize the homepage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it important to build the tracking into the homepage? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, important not only in final site but also in the beta sites etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there danger that some of the ppl who complain the loudest are not representative? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absolutely. Danger is that others in company look at emails, comments, blogs and assume it's representative. Good to have data to show that they're not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

                <title>Session 3: What's your Product Mgmnt Persona? #pcampldn</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;[Missed session 2 due to Apple Mail + Wireless fail.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian Lunn from Product Focus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only handful of ppl put hand up to Q of &quot;who thinks they're a good PM&quot; :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product Focus do survey on ProdMgmnt.
 - Ave PM has been a PM for 8.5yrs (up from 7.5yrs last yr)
 - 44% of time spent on firefighting and 56% on planned activities &quot;too much time on tactical&quot;
 - lack of clarity on role/responsibility
 - 51% of projects delivered on time (some ppl in room think that's
high)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective ProdMgmnt. Now we have a 2x2 matrix [notepad ain't gonna help me w that]. Axes are knowledge/skills and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 Personas
 - Numbers Guy
 - Subject Matter Expert
 - Expert Compromiser
 - Troubleshooter: Wild West Style
 - Product Champion/Advocate
 - Voice of Market
 - Reliable Project Manager
 - Multi-CEO (bit of everything)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biggest issue in ProdMgmnt in companies seems to be:
 - Lack of clarity on roles
 - lack of time for strategy
 - Ave salary is £61k base (cue murmurs from room...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job titles can be misleading. Can split work by activities.
 - Strategic PM Activities: Working out the right product
 - Inbound Activities: Helping business deliver the product
 - Outbound Activities: Helping business to sell the product&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has the role of PM changed over the years as it becomes more
recognised? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still a way to go. Better recognised but need more exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

                <title>Session 1: Data Driven Decisions #pcampldn</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Talk by Lucy from LoveFilm (@lucyjspence) Slides at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://slidesha.re/hFq1OB&quot;&gt;http://slidesha.re/hFq1OB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measure change through Experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About half the room has done some form of A/B testing before. Different changes, pages etc etc. Next thing to try is multivariate testing (MVT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radical A/B testing. Taken to an extreme you can have different journeys (separate website, even?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistical significance. Important to take note of since you need a certain volume of traffic before you can declare something as valid or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relation to product lifecycle. Lifecycle affects the kinds of tests you can do. Early on, can only do simple tests since you don't have volume to do valid MVT. As volume grows, then You can do more stuff and segment people. Eg separate ppl who come in via email campaign from other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advice:
- Respond to results
- Design for experimentation
- Design to segment/identify people by preference behaviour.
- Get the right tools for your org.
- Get ppl involved and pulling same direction
- Be prepared for things to go in the wrong direction from time to time. Don't get dispirited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q&amp;amp;A:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q Getting the right tools. Any recommendations? &lt;br /&gt;
A Google is a good start. website optimizer. Can let marketing ppl see what's going on. It's a monthly thing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A/B testing is great for testing ideas you've already got but doesn't help come up with new ideas. Does MVT etc help org come up with new ideas? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In some situations saying you can test things helps reduce risk. Depends on risk appetite of ppl too. It's just a tool so it just helps provide more info on what's happening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just moved desks from one side of the room to the other. While messing
with the cabling I also cleared out a bunch of nerf bullets from under
the desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if that's not ominous enough, behind me is what appears to be the
weapons stockpile (see pic above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to think that the New Year will bring peace, love and harmony
to this part of the building but that would be crazy talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be Switzerland (or maybe the Red Cross).&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Random things I learned at school</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the useful but slightly odd things that stuck with me from school came from one of the teachers I really didn't like. I never thought that particular class would have any relevance to the Rest Of My Life but here I am thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That one thing was a phrase that the teacher kept repeating, week after week. Anyone from my school will know exactly who I'm talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Make a statement, back it up with a quotation, then explain fully.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so the 'explain fully' part wasn't entirely explained (the irony), but I've found the general principle to be helpful when I'm trying to get my thoughts on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make your point. Provide some evidence. Explain it clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is on @nick_wood's desk. Yes, that's real hair. Yes, it's Nick's hair. So far you can see that it works on iPads and cakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure how much my therapy* will cost but it's going on expenses :-P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*that's therapy &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; a dustbuster&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Update: Turns out that it doesn't work as well on cakes as I previously thought. I'd take another photo, but the cake is gone...&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Collective Intelligence in Human Groups</title>
                <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Evidence for a Collective Intelligence Factor in the Performance of Human Groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anita Williams Woolley,&lt;sup&gt;1,*&lt;/sup&gt; Christopher F. Chabris,&lt;sup&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt;
Alexander Pentland,&lt;sup&gt;3,4&lt;/sup&gt; Nada Hashmi,&lt;sup&gt;3,5&lt;/sup&gt; Thomas W.
Malone&lt;sup&gt;3,5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have repeatedly shown that a single
statistical factor—often called &quot;general intelligence&quot;—emerges from
the correlations among people's performance on a wide variety of
cognitive tasks. But no one has systematically examined whether a
similar kind of &quot;collective intelligence&quot; exists for groups of
people. In two studies with 699 individuals, working in groups of two
to five, we find converging evidence of a general
collective intelligence factor that explains a group's performance on
a wide variety of tasks. This &quot;&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; factor&quot; is not strongly
correlated with the average or maximum individual intelligence of
group members but is correlated with the average social
sensitivity of group members, the equality in distribution of
conversational turn-taking, and the proportion of females in the
group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds like great work and it's one of the things I wanted to study just before I started my PhD. Interesting to see that performance correlates with social sensitivity as well as the proportion of females in the group. I'd be very interested to know exactly what &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of tasks the teams were asked to perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll have to wait till I'm next on campus before I can download the paper itself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was at a good friend's PhD viva a couple of weeks ago and I was impressed with the 'pomp and circumstance' surrounding it.  Basically, the Dutch do PhD vivas/ceremonies way better than the Brits, especially given how much blood, sweat and tears are involved in getting to that stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were lots of photos that day but I've managed to capture most of the story in the selection of pictures above. There are lots of differences between what I saw and the UK system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, it's obvious that the event is a public affair although seating is strictly limited so it's usually just friends and relatives of the graduand (he's the tall guy in the middle of the first pic).  There is a committee of examiners who can question the candidate, which includes his supervisor and the period of questioning lasts no more than 45 minutes.  That's it.  At the end of the 45th minute, the master of ceremonies (can't remember his official title) will stop whoever's speaking and usher the committee out to deliberate.  By contrast, in the UK, the event would be a private meeting with only two examiners (supervisor not present), lasting anywhere between 1.5 to 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, the comparison isn't really fair.  In the Dutch system, the viva is much more of a ceremony than an examination.  The Thesis will already have been read and approved long before the public defence takes place.  That's including any corrections that have been requested.  Therefore, barring allegations of plagiarism, the outcome of the viva is already known to everyone which lends a much more ceremonial air to the proceedings.  That doesn't make the questions any less tricky though.  Once the committee returns from it's recess, there are some proclamations and the degree itself is awarded (it's in the blue tube).  After that, there's a drinks reception and few family/friends head off for dinner.  Overall, a very civilised affair with the attention squarely on the graduate throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I thought the Dutch method of graduating was way better than the UK equivalent (the expense notwithstanding).  After spending several years working on research followed by the effort of writing it up, I've always felt the UK ceremony was a bit of a let down.  Over here, families sit in a large room full of strangers, and watch a procession of other strangers spend 30-45 seconds in front of a robed figure before picking up a sheet of paper on their way out of the back door.  There's a brief flurry of excitement as you see your (insert_relation_here) have their few seconds of attention followed by the realisation that you still have to sit through the remainder of the class before you can leave.  Not much of a celebration of the achievement in my opinion (not that I should disparage it too much since I have yet to finish myself!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the fundamental differences in how PhDs are examined between the UK and the Netherlands, I'm not sure what we could do to introduce more of an 'individual ceremony', though it would certainly be nice to try.  If I ever get there, I'm making sure I mark the occasion properly ... which reminds me, back to work. :)&lt;/p&gt;

You can have your Ph D superviser in the room at UK universities. I opted not to, but in retrospect wish I had had him there. Just back form the Netherlands and watcehd a Ph D defense. Fascinating!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>This time-lapse montage will blow your mind</title>
                <description>

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-video widescreen vimeo&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/14352658?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;304&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen=&quot;true&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; allowFullScreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Time lapse montage&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What? Were you trying to use your brain for something right this
moment? Please stop that. Stop your multitasking, your conference
calling, and your SMS messaging for 2 minutes and 24 seconds, just
long enough to enjoy this fantastic time-lapse montage from Mike
Flores. It’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video was shot with a Canon 5D MKII and various lenses, including
the Canon 16-35mm f2.8 II, Canon 14mm f2.8 II, and Canon 24mm f1.4 II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's the audio that makes this work so well. The scenes with people in
aren't that spectacular so they're a little distracting, when compared
to the epic nature scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girl: OW! You poked my eye!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy: No, I poked you &lt;strong&gt;IN&lt;/strong&gt; the eye. And according to you, there's a

                <title>Woah! Drinking tea prevents testicle shrinkage. Are you getting enough?</title>

&lt;p&gt;Wow. Random fact of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the recommended daily amount of Manganese is around few milligrams per day (some sites say up to a max of 11mg per day). The average cup of black tea has 0.2-0.8 mg of Manganese. Other sources of the mineral include soy, rice and beans and coffee (though I couldn't find how much there was in coffee)&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>I guess I'm going to have to play Starcraft 2</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/web/starcraft2-face.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Starcraft 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a slightly bizarre experience at lunch today. Pretty much everyone I sat with was talking about games they’d played in Starcraft II (see below). Words like &lt;em&gt;fast expand&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cruisers&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Zerg&lt;/em&gt; were being bandied about and for several minutes it felt like a different language (the terminology gets even more odd with things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=cheese+tactic&quot;&gt;cheese tactics&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, I speak English so I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; all the words but the order they were strung together in was alien to me. Direct peer pressure rarely works on me (and they’ve already tried) but apparently being part of a conversation where I’m failing to understand anything is like crack. I have to go off, google stuff and try and get a basic understanding. In this case, if I want to continue having lunch with these guys I’ll probably have to start playing. Given my tendency for getting addicted to (good) computer games, this could end badly for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, (this time) the conversation did move on to other topics, including male nurses and how PAs could take over the world. Epic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not surprisingly, the phone is designed for a world in which &quot;sharing
is the social norm.&quot; Not only will you be able to scroll through your
friends list and call people by tapping a button, Facebook will also
record who you called, what you said, and what you were wearing at the
time. This information will only be shared with law enforcement
agencies and carefully selected advertisers&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit to add:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also found the following more recently (Oct 2010)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Cambridge was voted best for research quality in a survey of 15,000 academics. It has an outstanding pedigree: famous minds who pushed back the frontiers of knowledge there include Newton, Darwin and Wittgenstein. Cambridge took overall first place in the rankings, which also use citation counts from a database of academic publishing&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantastic idea! I used to try doing this with recipes to make cooking easier but it always felt like too much effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there was a way to add your own recipes and have them presented back in this format, that would be really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;He got the name @paulg and @avibryant sorted it out for him. Seems like
the update hasn't filtered everywhere yet since I found the following at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://twittercounter.com/paulg?manual_update=1&quot;&gt;http://twittercounter.com/paulg?manual_update=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like the previous owner was a Paul Gardi. I wonder if he has any
idea how many followers his old handle now has (or will have soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awesome video. The summary says it's an artistic project and I think it came out really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost makes me want to dive. Almost, but not quite. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(hat-tip: Martina - she keeps sending me cool stuff)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantastic write up of a three year journey around the world. I've heard
of this guy before but never took the time to look him up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Found this great table of visualisations. Below is an image but you have
to visit the page at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html&quot; title=&quot;Periodic Table of Visualisations&quot;&gt;visual-literacy.org&lt;/a&gt; and hover over the 'elements' to see the examples. Neat.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Easily Aggregate Outlook, Google &amp; iCal calendar feeds</title>
                <description>&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t want to read the rest, here’s what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit the free service &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mashical.com&quot;&gt;MashiCal&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; create
a calendar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add each of your iCal feeds to your MashiCal calendar (adjust
settings as appropriate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the subscribe link (right-click and ‘copy link’ on the
aggregated calendar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You now have a link to an aggregated iCal feed of your calendar!\
 Below is the rest of the post for those with more patience ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/singles/Cal-Logos.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cal Logos&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why would anyone need to do this?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have multiple calendars, sharing free/busy information becomes
painful. One result is that too much time can be spent scheduling
meetings.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could combine all the calendar feeds into one free/busy feed then
I’d only have to share that one calendar with colleagues. So far none of
the applications I use are able to do this intelligently, and that’s
without the additional complexity of having multiple calendars in each
application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter MashiCal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Using MashiCal to merge .ics feeds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was already using BusyCal from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.busymac.com&quot;&gt;BusyMac&lt;/a&gt; so my
Apple iCal calendars sync with Google quite nicely. Therefore, I only
need to worry about getting my Google and Outlook calendars into one
feed. (NB It’s possible to publish a feed directly from Apple iCal so
you don’t need to buy any software)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Getting a feed from Google&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get your ics feed from your google calendar, visit the calendar’s
settings page. Make sure the calendar is shared otherwise the feed will
not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Getting a feed from Outlook&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Outlook 2007 you’ll need to right-click on the calendar you want to
create a feed for and “Publish to Internet”. When you’re prompted to
share the feed you just created you’ll be able to see the URL you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Aggregating the feeds&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have the iCal feeds you want to aggregate, visit MashiCal
and put them together. The interface is quite simple and MashiCal will
produce an Agenda view and provide a link at the top of the calendar
that you can share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware of the calendar settings for each feed you are entering since
timezones and refresh schedules may be relevant. Once it’s done you’ll
have a aggregated iCal feed that you can share with others. You can see
what my free/busy feed looks like
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mashical.com/cal?id=34df5231-84c6-475b-981e-6370459a84fb&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I’ve also collated my calendars into a general
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/pages/freebusy&quot;&gt;free/busy&lt;/a&gt; page too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this was useful. I wrote this since it took me a while to
discover MashiCal and thought it might be useful for others too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*I’m aware there are services that try and solve this problem (e.g
&lt;a href=&quot;http://MeetWith.me&quot;&gt;MeetWithMe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tungle.me&quot;&gt;Tungle.Me&lt;/a&gt;
come to mind). However, I’m more interested in having an aggregated
free/busy feed which people can subscribe to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

This is cool. The scenario that really needs to be solved is... 2 working parents needing to view each others work schedules as well as personal appointments, maybe personal hotmail or gmail calendars at home and each has an outlook calendar on different work domains. And maybe throw in a teenager's schedule into the mix. Some details you want all to see and some you want to keep private but busy. Now take these calendars and figure out how to view them on each parent's phone. I've been playing with outlook connector which is great when you're at a pc, but the phone experience is missing and you really need that when you're on the road. Has anyone figured out the aggregate when multiple people are involved, and how to do it cleanly on phones?&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>My first 3-way</title>
                <description>&lt;h3&gt;BCPA Monthly Draw – June&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m the guy in the white helmet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3e4t-BA20Jo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;lipsum&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The above was my first attempt at a proper 3-way skydive. If you look closely it becomes obvious that I’m being dragged around. I’ve clearly got some work to do before I can keep up with these guys by myself. We did get 7 or 8 points though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;About the video&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ukskydiver.co.uk/cms/index.php?/topic/9412-bcpa-about-contact-how-to-join/&quot;&gt;BCPA&lt;/a&gt; is the national student body that promotes skydiving. Every month there’s a draw of three formations. The idea is to complete the sequence of formations (and repeat) as many times as possible within the time allowed (35sec).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June was the last draw of this academic year and the formations in the video are Sputnik, Opal and Cluster. The divepool these formations came from can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://img638.imageshack.us/img638/5070/bcpafs3waydivepool.gif&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Learning Markdown</title>
                <description>&lt;h3&gt;My first attempt at markdown&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having come across &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt; some time ago, I’ve decided to give it a try. This post is basically my attempt at using as many of the tags as possible. At least those I’m likely to
need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Reasons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More control over how how posts &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be able to &lt;strong&gt;emphasise&lt;/strong&gt; things in plain text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because I prefer using plain text email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As Gruber says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markdown’s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format
for writing for the web&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping I can get used to it. The last thing I need is to give myself
another roadblock to writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;edit: I didn’t get the list stuff correct the first time around&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>This is my posterous</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I've finally set up a blog after procrastinating for several months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still not sure what I'll be doing with it but since it seems to run via
email I expect I'll actually use it a lot more than other services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next post will be a link to my 3-way skydive video. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Edit: This used to be Posterous, until I moved to Jekyll and GitHub Pages in April 2012&lt;/p&gt;
