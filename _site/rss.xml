                <title>Brewing MISO to serve Nymote</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org/blog/2013/introducing-nymote/&quot;&gt;mission of Nymote&lt;/a&gt; is to enable the creation of resilient
decentralised systems that incorporate privacy from the ground up, so that
users retain control of their networks and data.  To achieve this, we
reconsider all the old assumptions about how software is created in light of
the problems of the modern, networked environment.  Problems that will become
even more pronounced as more devices and sensors find their way into our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to make it simple for anyone to be able to run a piece of the cloud
for their own purposes and the first three applications Nymote targets are
Mail, Contacts and Calendars, but to get there, we first have to create solid
foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Defining the bedrock&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to create applications that work for the user, we first have to
create a robust and reliable software stack that takes care of fundamental
problems for us. In other words, to be able to assemble the applications we
desire, we must first construct the correct building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've taken a clean-slate approach so that we can build long-lasting solutions
with all the benefits of hindsight but none of the baggage. As
mentioned in earlier posts, there are three main components of the stack,
which are: &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org/software/mirage/&quot;&gt;Mirage&lt;/a&gt; (OS for the Cloud/IoT), &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org/software/irmin/&quot;&gt;Irmin&lt;/a&gt; (distributed datastore)
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org/software/signpost/&quot;&gt;Signpost&lt;/a&gt; (identity and connectivity) - all built using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org&quot;&gt;OCaml&lt;/a&gt;
programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Using the MISO stack to build Nymote&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you've already noticed, there's a useful acronym for the above tools —
&lt;strong&gt;MISO&lt;/strong&gt;. Each of the projects mentioned is a serious undertaking in its own
right and each is likely to be impactful as a stand-alone concept.  However,
when used together we have the opportunity to create applications and services
with high levels of security, scalability and stability, which are not easy to
achieve using other means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, MISO is the &lt;em&gt;toolstack&lt;/em&gt; that we're using to build Nymote —
Nymote is the &lt;em&gt;decentralised system&lt;/em&gt; that works for its users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the projects is at a different phase but they have all have made great
strides over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Mirage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mirage — a library operating system that constructs unikernels — is the most
mature part of the stack. I previously wrote about the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org/blog/2014/announcing-first-mirage-release/&quot;&gt;Mirage 1.0 release&lt;/a&gt; and only six months later we had an
&lt;a href=&quot;http://openmirage.org/blog/announcing-mirage-20-release&quot;&gt;impressive 2.0 release&lt;/a&gt;, with continuing advances throughout the year.
We achieved major milestones such as the ability to deploy unikernels to
ARM-based devices, as well as a clean-slate implementation of the transport
layer security (TLS) protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the development efforts, there have also been many
presentations to audiences, ranging from &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/describing-miso-entrepreneur-first-2014/&quot;&gt;small groups of startups&lt;/a&gt;
all the way to &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6443_-_en_-_saal_2_-_201412271245_-_trustworthy_secure_modular_operating_system_engineering_-_hannes_-_david_kaloper.html#video&quot;&gt;prestigious keynotes&lt;/a&gt; with 1000+ attendees.  Ever
since we've had ARM support, the talks themselves have been delivered from
unikernels running on Cubieboards and you can see the growing collection of
slides at &lt;a href=&quot;http://decks.openmirage.org&quot;&gt;decks.openmirage.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these activities have led to a tremendous increase in public awareness
of unikernels and the value they can bring to developing robust, modern
software as well as the promise of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@darrenrush/after-docker-unikernels-and-immutable-infrastructure-93d5a91c849e&quot;&gt;immutable infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;.
As more people look to get involved and contribute to the codebase, we've also
begun curating a set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Pioneer-Projects&quot;&gt;Pioneer Projects&lt;/a&gt;, which are suitable for a
range of skill-levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find much more information on all the activities of 2014 in the
comprehensive &lt;a href=&quot;http://openmirage.org/blog/2014-in-review&quot;&gt;Mirage review post&lt;/a&gt;. As it's the most mature
component of the MISO stack, anyone interested in the &lt;em&gt;development of code&lt;/em&gt;
towards Nymote should join the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.xenproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mirageos-devel&quot;&gt;Mirage mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source code&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mirage&quot;&gt;Mirage org on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Irmin&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irmin — a library to persist and synchronize distributed data structures —
made significant progress last year. It's based on the principles of Git, the
distributed version control system, and allows developers to choose the
appropriate combination of consistency, availability and partition tolerance
for their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early last year Irmin was released as an alpha with the ability to speak
'fluent Git' and by the summer, it was supporting user-defined merge
operations and fast in-memory views.  A couple of summer projects improved the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://gazagnaire.org/pub/FGM15.pdf&quot;&gt;merge strategies&lt;/a&gt; and synchronisation strategies, while an
external project — Xenstore — used Irmin to &lt;a href=&quot;http://openmirage.org/blog/introducing-irmin-in-xenstore&quot;&gt;add fault-tolerance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recent work has involved a big clean-up in the user-facing API (with nice
&lt;a href=&quot;http://samoht.github.io/irmin/&quot;&gt;developer documentation&lt;/a&gt;) and a cleaner high-level REST API.
Upcoming work includes proper documentation of the REST API, which means Irmin
can more easily be used in non-OCaml projects, and full integration with
Mirage projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irmin is already being used to create
&lt;a href=&quot;https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/imaplet-lwt/imaplet-lwt.0.1.3/&quot;&gt;a version controlled IMAP server&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/samoht/dog&quot;&gt;a version controlled distributed log system&lt;/a&gt;. It's no surprise
that the first major release is coming &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mirage/irmin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.0.0&quot;&gt;very soon&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source code&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mirage/irmin&quot;&gt;Irmin on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Signpost&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signpost will be a collection of libraries that aims to provide identity and
connectivity between devices.  Forming efficient connections between
end-points is becoming ever more important as the number of devices we own
increases. These devices need to be able to recognise and reach each-other,
regardless of their location on the network or the obstacles in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very much a nascent project and it involves a lot of work on
underlying libraries to ensure that security aspects are properly considered.
As such, we must take great care in how we implement things and be clear about
any trade-offs we make. Our thoughts are beginning to converge on a design we
think will work and that we would entrust with our own data, but we're
treating this as a case of 'Here Be Dragons'.  This is a critical piece of the
stack and we'll share what we learn as we chart our way towards it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we're at the design stage of Signpost, we did substantial work
last year to create the libraries we might use for implementation.  A
particularly exciting one is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MagnusS/jitsu&quot;&gt;Jitsu&lt;/a&gt; — which stands for Just In Time
Summoning of Unikernels. This is a DNS server that spawns unikernels in
response to DNS requests and boots them in real-time with no perceptible lag
to the end user.  In other words, it makes much more efficient use of
resources and significantly reduces latency of services for end-users —
services are only run &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; they need to be, in the &lt;em&gt;places&lt;/em&gt; they need to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also been lots of efforts on other libraries that will help us
&lt;em&gt;iterate towards&lt;/em&gt; a complete solution. Initially, we will use pre-existing
implementations but in time we can take what we've learned and create more
robust alternatives. Some of the libraries are listed below (but note the
friendly disclaimers!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source code&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dsheets/ocaml-sodium&quot;&gt;Bindings to libsodium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dsheets/ocaml-dnscurve&quot;&gt;Implementation of DNSCurve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dsheets/ocaml-libmacaroons&quot;&gt;Bindings to libmacaroons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;OCaml&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org&quot;&gt;OCaml&lt;/a&gt; is a mature, powerful and highly pragmatic language.  It's
proven ideal for creating robust systems applications and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org/learn/companies.html&quot;&gt;many others&lt;/a&gt; also recognise this.  We're using it to create all the
tools you've read about so far and we're also helping to improve the ecosystem
around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the major things we've been involved with is the coordination of the
OCaml Platform, which combines the OCaml compiler with a coherent set of tools
and workflows to be more productive in the language and speed up development
time.  We presented the first major release of these efforts at OCaml 2014 and
you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2014/ocaml2014_7.pdf&quot;&gt;read the abstract&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxhtpQ5nJHg&amp;amp;list=UUP9g4dLR7xt6KzCYntNqYcw&quot;&gt;watch the video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's more to come, as we continue to improve the tooling and also support
the community in &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/towards-governance-framework-for-ocamlorg&quot;&gt;other ways&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Early steps towards applications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building blocks are important but we also need to push towards working
applications.  There are different approaches we've taken to this, which
include building prototypes, wireframing use-cases and implementing features
with other toolstacks.  Some of this work is also part of a larger
&lt;a href=&quot;http://usercentricnetworking.eu&quot;&gt;EU funded project&lt;/a&gt;* and below are brief summaries of the things we've
done so far. We'll expand on them as we do more over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mail&lt;/strong&gt; - As mentioned above, a prototype IMAP server exists (&lt;a href=&quot;https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/imaplet-lwt/imaplet-lwt.0.1.3/&quot;&gt;IMAPlet&lt;/a&gt;)
which uses Irmin to store data. This is already able to connect to a client to
serve mail. The important feature is that it's an IMAP server which is version
controlled in the backend and can expose a REST API from the mailstore quite
easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contacts&lt;/strong&gt; - We first made wireframe mockups of the features we might like
in a contacts app (to follow in later post) and then built a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yansh/contacts-app&quot;&gt;draft implementation&lt;/a&gt;. To get here, code was first written in OCaml
and then put through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/&quot;&gt;js_of_ocaml&lt;/a&gt; compiler. This is valuable as it
takes us closer to a point where we can build networks using our address books
and have the system take care of sharing details in a privacy-conscious manner
and with minimal maintenance. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://yansnotes.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/work-summary-ocaml-labs.html&quot;&gt;summary post&lt;/a&gt; has more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calendar&lt;/strong&gt; - This use-case was approached in a completely different way as
part of a hackathon last year. A rough but functional prototype was built over
one weekend, with a team formed at the event.  It was centralised but it
tested the idea that a service which integrates intimately with your life (to
the point of being very invasive) can provide disproportionate benefits.  The
&lt;a href=&quot;http://seedcamp.com/seedhack-5-0/&quot;&gt;experience report&lt;/a&gt; describes the weekend and our app — Clarity —
won first place. This was &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; validation that the features are desirable
so we need to work towards a decentralised, privacy-conscious version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Time to get involved!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coming year represents the best time to be working on the MISO stack and
using it to make Nymote a reality.  All source code is publicly available and
the projects are varied enough that there is something for everyone.  Browse
through issues, consider the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Pioneer-Projects&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; or simply write online and
share with us the things you'd like to see.
This promises to be an exciting year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;* The research leading to these results has received
funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013
under the UCN project, grant agreement no 611001.

                <title>Unikernels for everyone!</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people have now set up unikernels for blogs, documenting their
experiences for others to follow.  Even more important is that people are
going beyond static sites to build unikernels that provide more complicated
services and solve real-world problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help newcomers get started, there are now even more posts that that use
different tools and target different deployment methods.  Below are summaries
of some of the posts I found interesting and that will make it easier for you
try out different ways of creating and deploying your unikernels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Unikernel blogs with MirageOS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindy picked up where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/from-jekyll-to-unikernel-in-fifty-lines/&quot;&gt;first set of instructions&lt;/a&gt;
finished and described her work to get an Octopress blog running on Amazon EC2.
As one of the first people outside the core team to work on this, she had a
lot of interesting experiences — which included getting into the Mirage
networking stack to debug an issue and submit a bugfix!  More recently, she
also wrote a couple of excellent posts on &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; she uses a unikernel for her
blog.  These posts cover the security concerns (and responsibility) of running
networked services on today's Internet and the importance of owning your
content — both ideas are at the heart of the work behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org/&quot;&gt;Nymote&lt;/a&gt; and are
well worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mindy's posts&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overview&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.somerandomidiot.com/blog/2014/08/18/i-am-unikernel/&quot;&gt;&quot;I Am Unikernel (and So Can You!)&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;First in her Mirage series&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.somerandomidiot.com/blog/2014/03/14/its-a-mirage/&quot;&gt;&quot;It's a Mirage! (or, How to Shave a Yak.)&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.somerandomidiot.com/blog/2014/08/11/attack-surface-area/&quot;&gt;&quot;Attack Surface: Why I Unikernel, Part 1&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.somerandomidiot.com/blog/2014/08/14/my-content-is-mine/&quot;&gt;&quot;My Content Is Mine: Why I Unikernel, Part 2&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ian took a different path to AWS deployment by using Vagrant and Test Kitchen
to to get his static site together and build his unikernel, and then Packer to
create the images for deployment to EC2.  All succinctly explained with code
available on GitHub for others to try out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ian on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/iw/mirage-jekyll&quot;&gt;&quot;Mirage with Jekyll on Amazon EC2&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Toby wanted to put together a blog that was a little more complicated than a
traditional static site, with specific features like subdomains based on tags
and the ability to set future dates for posts. He also pulled in some other
libraries so he can use Mustache for sever-side rendering, where his blog
posts and metadata are stored as JSON and rendered on request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toby on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.is-awesome.net/2014/11/building-a-blog-with-mirage-os&quot;&gt;&quot;Building a Blog with MirageOS&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Chris saw others working to get unikernel blogs on EC2 and decide he'd try
getting his up and running on Linode instead.  He is the first person to
deploy his unikernel to Linode and he provided a great walkthough with helpful
screenshots, as well as brief notes about the handful of differences compared
with EC2.  Chris also wrote about the issue he had with clean urls (i.e
serving &lt;code&gt;/about/index.html&lt;/code&gt; when a user visits &lt;code&gt;/about/&lt;/code&gt;) — he describes the
things he tried out until he was finally able to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris' posts&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Setting up a unikernel&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://christopherbothwell.com/ocaml/mirage/2014/12/03/about-not-found.html&quot;&gt;&quot;About Not Found&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deploying to Linode&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://christopherbothwell.com/ocaml/mirage/linode/2014/12/08/hello-linode.html&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello Linode&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Phil focused on getting unikernels running on a cubieboards, which are ARM
based development boards — similar to the Raspberry Pi. He starts by taking
Mirage's pre-built &lt;a href=&quot;http://blobs.openmirage.org&quot;&gt;Cubieboard images&lt;/a&gt; — which makes it easy to
get Xen and an OCaml environment set up on the board — and getting this
installed on the Cubieboard.  He also noted the issues he came across along
with the simple tweaks he made to fix them and finally serves a Mirage hello
world page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phil on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://philtomson.github.io/blog/2014/09/10/some-notes-on-building-and-running-mirage-unikernels-on-cubieboard2/&quot;&gt;&quot;Some Notes on Building and Running Mirage Unikernels on Cubieboard2&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;More than just static sites&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static sites have become the new 'hello world' app. They're simple to manage,
low-risk and provide lots of opportunities to experience something new.  These
aspects make them ideal for discovering the benefits (and trade offs) of the
unikernel approach and I look forward to seeing what variations people come up
with — For instance, there aren't any public instructions for deploying to
Rackspace so it would be great to read about someone's experiences there.
However, there are also many other applications that also fit the above
criteria of simplicity, low risk and plentiful learning opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Leonard decided to create a unikernel for a simple REST service for
queuing package uploads for 0install.  His post takes you from the very
beginning, with a simple hello world program running on Xen, all the way
through to creating his REST service. Along the way there a lots of code
snippets and explanations of the libraries being used and what they're doing.
This is a great use-case for unikernels and there are a lot of interesting
things to take from this post, for example the ease with which Thomas was able
to find and fix bugs using regular tools. There's also lots of information on
performance testing and optimising of the unikernel, which he covers in a
follow-up post, and he even built tools to visualise the traces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thomas' posts&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello world and REST service&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2014/07/28/my-first-unikernel/&quot;&gt;&quot;My First Unikernel&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Profiling and optimisations&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2014/08/15/optimising-the-unikernel/&quot;&gt;&quot;Optimising the Unikernel&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tool to visualise traces&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2014/10/27/visualising-an-asynchronous-monad&quot;&gt;&quot;Visualising an Asynchronous Monad&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of course, there's much more activity out there than described in this post as
people continually propose ideas on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.xenproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mirageos-devel&quot;&gt;Mirage mailing list&lt;/a&gt; — both
for things they would like to try out and issues they came up against. In my
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org/blog/2014/from-jekyll-site-to-unikernel/&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, I pointed out that the workflow is applicable to any
type of unikernel and as Thomas showed, with bit of effort it's already
possible to create useful, real-world services using the many libraries that
already exist. There's also a lot of scaffolding in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton&quot;&gt;mirage-skeleton&lt;/a&gt;
repo that you can build on which makes it even easier to get involved.  If you
want to dive deeper into the libraries and perhaps learn OCaml, there are lots
of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org/learn/books.html&quot;&gt;resources online&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Pioneer-Projects&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; to get involved with too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is a great time to try building a unikernel for yourself and as you can
see from the posts above, shared experiences help other people progress
further and branch out into new areas. When you've had a chance to try
something out please do share your experiences online!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;This post also appears on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org/blog/2015/unikernels-for-everyone/&quot;&gt;Nymote blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Towards a governance framework for OCaml.org</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The projects around the OCaml.org domain name are becoming more established
and it's time to think about how they're organised. 2014 saw a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of
activity, which built on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/news/index.html#OnlineatOCamlorg&quot;&gt;successes from 2013&lt;/a&gt;.
Some of the main things that stand out to me are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org/contributors.html&quot;&gt;volunteers&lt;/a&gt; contributing to the public website with
translations, bug fixes and content updates, as well as many new visitors —
for example, the new page on &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org/learn/teaching-ocaml.html&quot;&gt;teaching OCaml&lt;/a&gt; received over 5k
visits alone. The increasing contributions are a result of the earlier work on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/announcing-new-ocamlorg/&quot;&gt;re-engineering the site&lt;/a&gt; and there are many ways to get involved
so please do &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/labels/contribute%21&quot;&gt;contribute&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://opam.ocaml.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 10px&quot; src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/web/opampkg-2015-01-08.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relentless improvements and growth of OPAM, both in terms of the
repository — with over 1000 additional packages and several
&lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/opam-devel/2014-October/000781.html&quot;&gt;new repo maintainers&lt;/a&gt; — and also improved workflows (e.g the new
&lt;a href=&quot;http://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-1-2-pin/&quot;&gt;pin functionality&lt;/a&gt;).
The OPAM site and package list also moved to the ocaml.org domain, becoming
the substrate for the OCaml Platform efforts. This began with the work towards
&lt;a href=&quot;http://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-1-2-0-beta4/&quot;&gt;OPAM 1.2&lt;/a&gt; and there is much more to come (including closer
integration in terms of styling). Join the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/platform&quot;&gt;Platform list&lt;/a&gt; to
keep up to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much more activity on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.ocaml.org&quot;&gt;mailing lists&lt;/a&gt; in general and user groups
requesting to have lists made (e.g the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/teaching&quot;&gt;teaching list&lt;/a&gt;). If anyone
has a need for a new list, just ask on the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure&quot;&gt;infrastructure list&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is other work besides those I've mentioned and I think by any measure,
all the projects have been quite successful. As the community continues to
develop, it's important to clarify how things currently work to improve the
level of transparency and make it easier for newcomers to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Factors for a governance framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of months, I've been looking over how larger projects
manage themselves and the governance documents that are available. My aim has
been to put such a document together for the OCaml.org domain without
introducing burdensome processes.  There are number of things that stood out
to me during this process, which have guided the approach I'm taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My considerations for an OCaml.org governance document:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A governance document is not &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for success but it's valuable to
demonstrate a commitment to a &lt;strong&gt;stable decision-making process&lt;/strong&gt;.  There are
many projects that progress perfectly well without any documented processes
and indeed the work around OCaml.org so far is a good example of this (as well
as OCaml itself).  However, for projects to achieve a scale greater than the
initial teams, it's a significant benefit to encode in writing how things work
(NB: please note that I didn't define the &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of decision-making process -
merely that it's a stable one).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It must &lt;strong&gt;clarify its scope&lt;/strong&gt; so that there is no confusion about what the
document covers. In the case of OCaml.org, it needs to be clear that the
governance covers the domain itself, rather than referring to the website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should &lt;strong&gt;document the reality&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than represent an aspirational
goal or what people &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; a governance structure should look like.  It's
very tempting to think of an idealised structure without recognising that
behaviours and norms have &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; been established. Sometimes this will be
vague and poorly defined but that might simply indicate areas that the
community hasn't encountered yet (e.g it's uncommon for any new project to
seriously think about dispute resolution processes until they have to).  In
this sense, the initial version of a governance document should simply be a
written description of how things currently stand, rather than a means to
adjust that behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should be &lt;strong&gt;simple and self-contained&lt;/strong&gt;, so that anyone can understand
the intent quickly without recourse to other documents.  It may be tempting to
consider every edge-case or try to resolve every likely ambiguity but this
just leads to large, legal documents.  This approach may well be necessary
once projects have reached a certain scale but to implement it sooner would be
a case of premature optimisation — not to mention that very few people would
read and remember such a document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a &lt;strong&gt;living document&lt;/strong&gt;. If the community decides that it would prefer a
new arrangement, then the document conveniently provides a stable starting
point from which to iterate. Indeed, it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; adapt along with the project
that it governs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With the above points in mind, I've been putting together a draft governance
framework to cover how the OCaml.org domain name is managed.  It's been a
quiet work-in-progress for some time and I'll be getting in touch with
maintainers of specific projects soon.  Once I've had a round of reviews, I'll
be sharing it more widely and posting it here!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;




 --&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm speaking to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://joinef.com&quot;&gt;Entrepreneur First&lt;/a&gt; cohort this morning about the future of resilient, distributed systems and what I'm working on to get us there.  Firstly, I'm describing the kinds of solutions we have today, the great things they offer developers as well as the issues they create. This leads into the new toolstack we're creating, called the MISO stack, and the benefits and trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm spending more time talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://openmirage.org&quot;&gt;Mirage OS&lt;/a&gt; -- the 'M' in the MISO stack -- because the workflow we've developed here underpins how we build, deploy and maintain such applications at scale. As an example of how things can work, I point at my earlier post on how to go from &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/from-jekyll-to-unikernel-in-fifty-lines&quot;&gt;jekyll to unikernel&lt;/a&gt;.  This uses TravisCI to do all the hard work and all the relevant artefacts, including the final VM, can be version-controlled through Git. I actually deployed this post while the audience was watching, so that I could point at &lt;a href=&quot;http://travisci.org/amirmc/amirmc.github.com&quot;&gt;the build logs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the use cases for our toolstack is to make it possible for individuals to create and maintain their own piece of the cloud, a project called &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org&quot;&gt;Nymote&lt;/a&gt;, which will also make it possible to run the &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/working-on-the-internet-of-my-things/&quot;&gt;Internet of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; Things&lt;/a&gt; -- which itself is related to another things I'm working on, such the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hubofallthings.com&quot;&gt;Hub of All Things - HAT&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://usercentricnetworking.eu&quot;&gt;User Centric Networking&lt;/a&gt; projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting summer for all the tools we're putting together, since we've recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://openmirage.org/blog/announcing-mirage-20-release&quot;&gt;announced Mirage OS v2.0&lt;/a&gt;, which now works on ARM, are going full steam ahead with &lt;a href=&quot;http://openmirage.org/blog/introducing-irmin&quot;&gt;Irmin&lt;/a&gt; and working hard on improvements to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/tasks/platform.html&quot;&gt;OCaml ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;. It's a great time to explore these projects, learn a new language and build awesome stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Winning Seedhack 5.0</title>
                <description>

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;[This story was also a
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://seedcamp.com/seedhack-5-0/&quot;&gt;guest post&lt;/a&gt;
    on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://seedcamp.com&quot;&gt;Seedcamp&lt;/a&gt; blog.]&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I took part in &lt;a href=&quot;http://seedhack.com&quot;&gt;Seedhack 5.0&lt;/a&gt;, on the theme
of life-logging. My team were overall winners with Clarity, our calendar
assistant app. This post captures my experiences of what happened over the
weekend, the process of how we built the app and the main things I learned.
You'll find out what Clarity is at the end -- just like we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Meeting people and pitches on Friday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weekend began with some information on the APIs available to us, which
was followed by pizza and mingling with everyone. I spoke to a few people
about what they were working on and the technologies they were used to. It
was good to find a mixture of experience and I was specifically looking for
folks with an interest in functional programming -- that's how I first met
Vlad over Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vla_ve/statuses/485083697172185088&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tweets with Vlad&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After pizza, those people with ideas, even if not fully formed, were invited
to share them with the room. I came in to Seedhack with specific thoughts on
the kind of things I wanted to work on so I spoke about one of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pitching Personal Clouds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I described the problem of silos, poor interoperability and how all the
life-logging data should really be owned by the user. That would allow third
parties to request access and provide way more value to users, while
maintaining privacy and security. Building a centralised service makes a lot
of sense in the first instance but what's more disruptive than eschewing the
current model of yet-another-silo and putting the user in control? If that
sounds familiar, it's because I'm trying to solve these problems already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a open source toolstack for building distributed systems that
I call the MISO stack, which is analogous to the LAMP stack of old but
is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://openmirage.org&quot;&gt;Mirage OS&lt;/a&gt;.  With this stack, I'm putting together a
system to help people create and run their own little piece of the cloud
-- &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org&quot;&gt;Nymote&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org/blog/2013/introducing-nymote/&quot;&gt;introductory post&lt;/a&gt; and my post on
'&lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/working-on-the-internet-of-my-things/&quot;&gt;The Internet of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; Things&lt;/a&gt;' has more detail on why I'm working
on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For systems like this to be viable, we must be willing to trust them with
the core applications of Email, Contacts and Calendar. Without advanced and
robust options for running these, it's unlikely that anyone (including me)
would want to switch away from the current providers. Of these three
applications, I decided to talk about the contact management solution, since
I happen to have wireframes and thought it might be simpler to implement
something over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
Some readers may not be convinced but I like to recall a 1977 quote by Ken
Olsen, Cofounder and CEO of Digital Equipment Corp., who said *&quot;[There is no
reason for any individual to have a computer in his home][olsen].&quot;* We now
carry computers in our pockets (see footnote), so it's perfectly reasonable
to me that we'll all have our own clouds one day.
--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There was quite a bit of interest in the overall concept but what really
piqued my curiosity was that someone else presented some thoughts around
Calendars and analytics. After a brief chat, we decided to join forces and
tackle the problems of Calendar management. The team had a great mix of
experience from product to design and several of them had worked together
before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Clarity Team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com&quot;&gt;Amir&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Product&lt;/em&gt; - Worked in several startups, product &amp;amp; programme management experience, currently a Post Doc at Cambridge University Computer Science dept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rivertam57&quot;&gt;River&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Product&lt;/em&gt; - Programme Manager at Dotforge Accelerator and lead organiser of StartupBus UK 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://msingh.co&quot;&gt;Mani&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Developer&lt;/em&gt; - Freelance web dev (CMS and APIs), winner of multiple hackathons, currently studying at Sheffield University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vladvelici.github.io&quot;&gt;Vlad&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Developer&lt;/em&gt; - Started programming long ago and attended many competitions and hackathons. Currently studying Computer Science at the University of Southampton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://linkedin.com/in/joaoaparicio&quot;&gt;João&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Developer&lt;/em&gt; - PhD in Theoretical Physics, Python enthusiast and moving into data science, currently doing data analysis at Potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jchui.me&quot;&gt;Jeremy&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Designer&lt;/em&gt; - Freelance UI/UX Designer, hackathon enthusiast, currently studying medicine at Sheffield University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Thick fog and ambiguity on Friday evening&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had all decided to work together and we knew it would be on the problem
of calendar management and analytics. We were fired up but it quickly became
obvious that was &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; we knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next four to five &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt; were spent discussing the rough shape of what
we were going to build, what specific problem we thought we were solving and
whether there were enough people with such a problem to care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a look at each other's calendars and talked about how we each use
them and the things we like and dislike about them. For example, I have
around nine calendars and I curate them carefully, adding contextual
information and sometimes even correcting old events to reflect what
happened. We even bounced around the idea of the contact management app
several times as well as a few other ideas that came up during the
discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These conversations took a while and it seemed like we were going around in
circles. Despite this, it didn't feel particularly frustrating. I realised
that the same sticking point was coming up repeatedly because we were
forcing ourselves to imagine a prototypical customer and the problems &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt;
might have. This was never going to work since we wouldn't have time to go
and find such people and do basic customer development. Far better to
constrain the problem to something &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; experience so that we can look to
ourselves for initial customer feedback.  Once we did this, things seemed to
go a little faster and taking breaks for food helped us keep our energy up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/inthecompanyof/status/485463322020839424&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mani grabbing falafel for dinner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few occasions where I looked around the room and saw other
teams with their heads down, headphones in, and bashing away at keyboards
-- we hadn't even figured out what we were doing yet.
Despite this, it was a great exercise because it allowed all of us to get a
feel for what aspects each of us cared about most and it helped us form some
kind of shared language for the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only outcome from this first evening was an outline but it was an
important one. It distilled what we what we were going to work on and the
components of it. We did this so we'd have a clear starting point the next
morning and could get going quickly.  Here's a paraphrased version of what
we sent ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Smart Calendar App.

We are collecting data from mobile and from desktop. 
- Mobile includes:
  - Call logs
  - Location (if we can)
  - Messages
  - What application is being used and when
- Desktop includes:
  - What application is active and timestamps of it
  - Location?
  - Git Logs ... ?
  - Taking logs of their existing calendars.

Working out what people are doing.

Present info back via calendar UI
- Need to turn all this information into webcal events

Useful info we want
- Time spent travelling (how much?)

&lt;p&gt;Then it was time for some late night snacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nicolagreco/status/485201493633826818&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Midnight snacks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one challenge out of the way, the next one was finding somewhere to
sleep for a few hours (Campus was closing from 01:30). I had nothing planned
but luckily for me, a couple of team members had booked a hotel room for the
night. The minor complication was that we had to first find the hotel and
then somehow get six people into a room meant for two -- without the night
manager kicking us out. That's a whole other story, but it suffices to say
that James Bond has nothing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Rays of light and clearing haze on Saturday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some card games and a few hours of sleep, we headed back to Campus and
during this walk, we came up with 'Clarity' as the name of the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we arrived, development began. River volunteered his digital
assets to the cause (i.e. his whole Google life). Mani worked on the Android
app, Vlad on a Chrome extension with Joao pulling in the Google Apps data as
well as combining it with data from the various platform apps. Jeremy worked
on the front-end of the site, while River and I began wireframing the UI and
user flow through the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the development was well underway, I realised how superfluous 'the
business guys' can be. It would have been easy to simply sit there and let
everyone get on with it but there were other things River and I did while
developers were writing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wireframing&lt;/em&gt; - We spent time thinking about what a user would actually see
and engage with once they visited the Clarity site. We made a lot of
sketches on paper and this was helpful because communication with the team
was smoother with something to guide the discussion. It also helped to
inform the design work and gave River and I something to show to potential
users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Talk to people&lt;/em&gt; - aka early customer development. We already knew that we
were our own customers but it was useful to talk to other people for two
reasons. Firstly, to get an idea of how they use their calendars and whether
they have similar problems to us and secondly, to see what thoughts we
prompt when we describe our solution (or show our wireframes). This led to
useful information on how we should refine the product and and position
ourselves against perceived competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Refine the product&lt;/em&gt; - Going through the wireframing and talking to people
helped us come up with several new ideas for how to display the data back to
users. Some of these seemed great at the time, but after showing some paper
sketches to other people, we realised customers didn't care about certain
things, so we discarded them. Even though Jeremy had already done the work of
putting together the UI for them (sorry, Jeremy!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Examine the competition&lt;/em&gt; - After we described what we were working on. A
few people mentioned potential competitors and asked how we were different.
Initially, we didn't know much about these companies but it was something we
could explore while development was underway and consider our positioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remind people to regroup&lt;/em&gt; - Every few hours, we would make sure everyone
caught up with each other.  We would check that things were going well, share
what we'd learned from talking to people and discuss any technical problems
and possible workarounds -- including changing the scope of the product. The
discussions we'd had on Friday meant that we spent less time debating when
these questions came up during the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Work on the pitch&lt;/em&gt; - River and I began working on the pitch from just after
Saturday lunchtime and kept building on it until Sunday afternoon. This,
combined with showing our sketches to people, made it much easier to think
about the story we wanted to tell the audience. In turn, that made it easier
to think about the product development that &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to be completed by Sunday.
Especially in terms of a kick-ass demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mindeedly/status/485502064437780480&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Popcorn and candyfloss&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bright sunshine and achieving Clarity on Sunday afternoon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development carried on through the night and we took a break to watch some
sports via River's laptop -- at this point Clarity was actually logging this
and other events.
The next morning, we reiterated what we needed to
get done for the demo and I was pretty ruthless about practising the pitch.
River and I practised endlessly while everyone else made sure the the
technical pieces were working smoothly. We had a lot of moving parts and
making sure they were glued together seamlessly was important.
At this point, we knew what Clarity was and how to tell its story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introducing Clarity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have calendars and we put a lot of time and effort into managing them
but get very little back. A simple glance at your calendar for the past
month will show you a sea of information with no idea where your time was
actually spent. We believe your calendar should be working harder for you.
Your calendar should give you clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Calendar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the weekend, we built tools that can go through your
calendar and understand the events you're involved in and tie them back to
the relevant emails, documents and people.  With a suite of software that
spans across your GDrive, Chrome and Android, we're able to combine your
calendars with rich, contextual information so you can really understand
what your time is being spent on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://clarityapp.me&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Clarity summary view&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We built this system and plugged it into River's digital life.
If we take a look at River's summary for the last month, we see that he's
spent around 32 hours in meetings in London last month, despite living in
Sheffield. We can also see that he's spent an hour on the phone with someone
called Lee, but that all of them were short calls. The next person also
totalled an hour on the phone but only across 3 calls.  Already, River has
learned something about the the people he interacts with most and how. We
can also drill down further and see all this activity presented in a
calendar view, except this now represents where his time &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; go, rather
than where he thought it went. For example, he's most active via text
message between 4pm and 5pm during the week, and we can see that he spent
a few hours watching sports last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clarity can do much more than provide an accurate retrospective view of your
time. Since it interacts with all the important components of your life,
like your phone and laptop, it can even perform helpful actions for you.
For example, say I have a meeting set up with River but I want to reschedule
it. I simply send a text to him as I normally would, suggesting that we move
it to another day. Clarity can pick up that message and is smart enough to
understand its intent, find the relevant calendar event and &lt;em&gt;reschedule
it automatically&lt;/em&gt;. River doesn't have to lift a finger and his diary is
always up to date. It's easy to imagine a future where we might never have
to add or edit events ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clarity is a smart calendar assistant that understands the context around
you, provides you with insight into your life and helps you seamlessly
organise your future. You can find out more at

&lt;h3&gt;Judging and announcements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the pitches, we met a lot of people who had the same problems as we
did with calendar management. Several offered to be beta testers. After
waiting for the judges, prizes were announced and Clarity was declared the
overall winner of Seedhack 5.0!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Things I learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, there were a lot of things we did which I think
helped us get to the winning slot, so I thought I'd summarise them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think first&lt;/strong&gt; - We spent time up front to &lt;em&gt;define&lt;/em&gt; what we were
going to work on. I thought this step was crucial as it meant we all
understood the shape of the problem but also the areas that each of us were
interested in.  That helped later in the weekend as we could refer back to
things we discussed on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move fast&lt;/strong&gt; - Once we did figure out what we were doing, then it was a
matter of building the software to gather and crunch the data. A lot of this
was done in parallel as Jeremy worked on the front-end UI while Mani, Joao
and Vlad took care of the data aggregation, analytics and platform products.
Don't be afraid to throw away ideas if you find that they don't work for
people and remember it's a &lt;em&gt;hackathon&lt;/em&gt; (i.e gruesome hacks are the norm).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember the demo&lt;/strong&gt; - At some point you're going to be forced to stand up
and talk about what you've done. We started thinking about this from
Saturday lunchtime and sketched out the slides and the elements of the app
we wanted to show. This helped inform the UI and technology that we were
building and the pitch never felt like it was rushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice, practice, practice&lt;/strong&gt; - we were told we'd have 3 minutes to
pitch/demo and maybe a few additional questions. I made sure River and I
practised &lt;em&gt;repeatedly&lt;/em&gt; to get our time down to 3mins and ensure we getting
across everything we wanted to.  The important thing with such a
short amount of time, is that we were forced to &lt;em&gt;cut&lt;/em&gt; things out as well as
ensure we emphasised the main points. It was a ruthless exercise in saying
'no'. During the actual pitches, we realised everyone was taking longer
(without repercussions), so I added an extra 30 seconds to cover the
potential market sizes and business models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leave artefacts&lt;/strong&gt; - After the pitches, we knew that we had to take the
site down. It was built at high speed and in a way that ended up exposing
someone's data to the internet at large (thanks, River!). It might have
been somewhat easier to build something using faked data that we could
happily share the URL to and leave online.  On the other hand, our demo
would not have been half as compelling if we weren't running it real-time
on live data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Looking to the future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a product we all want to use and the team is interested in taking
this forward. There are a lot of things to think about and many
things we would build differently so we're discussing the next steps. For
example, there are likely ways to empower the end-users to control their
data and give them more flexibility, even though the work at the hackathon
was already quite impressive. Given how well Seedhack went, you might even
see us at &lt;a href=&quot;http://seedcamp.com/events/seedcamp-week-london/&quot;&gt;Seedcamp Week&lt;/a&gt; later in the year. If you think this is
something you'd like to work on with us,
&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:amirmc+clarity@gmail.com&quot;&gt;do get in touch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wrap things up, here's a victory selfie!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;**Footnote: It's worth reading the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.snopes.com/quotes/kenolsen.asp&quot;&gt;linked article&lt;/a&gt; as
the quote is usually taken out of context -- did you notice that I'm guilty
of that too? :). Ken actually &lt;strong&gt;did&lt;/strong&gt; understand the value of
PCs and having them at home. What he was disputing was that we would have
computers everywhere that would be running our lives. There's delicious
irony here because that is &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; the promise of the
Internet of Things and 'Big Data'. Systems that know us better than we know
ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Writing Planet in pure OCaml</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I've been learning OCaml for some time now but not really had a problem that
I wanted to solve. As such, my progress has been rather slow and sporadic
and I only make time for exercises when I'm travelling. In order to focus my
learning, I have to identify and tackle something specific. That's usually
the best way to advance and I recently found something I can work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I've been trying to write more blog posts, I want to be able to keep as
much content on my own site as possible and syndicate my posts out to other
sites I run. Put simply, I want to be able to take multiple feeds from
different sources and merge them into one feed, which will be served from
some other site. In addition, I also want to render that feed as HTML on a
webpage. All of this has to remain within the OCaml toolchain so it can be
used as part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://openmirage.org/&quot;&gt;Mirage&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. I can use it when
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/from-jekyll-to-unikernel-in-fifty-lines&quot;&gt;building unikernels&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I'm describing might sound familiar and there's a well-known tool that
does this called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)&quot;&gt;Planet&lt;/a&gt;. It's a 'river of news' feed reader, which
aggregates feeds and can display posts on webpages and you can find the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.planetplanet.org&quot;&gt;original Planet&lt;/a&gt; and it's successor &lt;a href=&quot;http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/docs/index.html&quot;&gt;Venus&lt;/a&gt;, both written in Python.
However, Venus seems to be unmaintained as there are a number of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rubys/venus/issues&quot;&gt;unresolved issues and pull requests&lt;/a&gt;, which have been
languishing for quite some time with no discussion. There does appear to be
a more active Ruby implementation called &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedreader.github.io/&quot;&gt;Pluto&lt;/a&gt;, with recent commits and
no reported issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 
    \[Rant: Frankly, the naming of these versions leaves a lot to be desired.
    When you know exactly what you're supposed to Google for you're fine, but
    until then you're just on a random-walk through space websites. I'm
    lucky I managed to get to the Wikipedia page.\] 
--&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Benefits of a Planet in pure OCaml&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I could use the one of the above options, it would be much more
useful to keep everything within the OCaml ecosystem.  This way I can make
the best use of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2566628&quot;&gt;unikernel approach&lt;/a&gt; with Mirage (i.e lean,
single-purpose appliances). Obviously, the existing options don't lend
themselves to this approach and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;amp;aid=1349&amp;amp;group_id=1&amp;amp;atid=101&quot;&gt;known bugs&lt;/a&gt; as a lot has
changed on the web since Planet Venus (e.g the adoption of HTML5).
Having said that, I can learn a lot from the existing implementations and
I'm glad I'm not embarking into completely uncharted territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the OCaml version doesn't need to (and &lt;em&gt;shouldn't&lt;/em&gt;) be written
as one monolithic library.  Instead, pulling together a collection of
smaller, reusable libraries that present clear interfaces to each other
would make things much more maintainable. This would bring substantially
greater benefits to everyone and &lt;a href=&quot;https://opam.ocaml.org/&quot;&gt;OPAM&lt;/a&gt; can manage the dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
    OPAM makes managing dependencies easy so having a number of single-
    purpose libraries is A Good Thing and costs almost nothing.  This 
    approach has already worked well with examples like an [IP address 
    library][ipaddr] and the [OCaml markdown library][OMD], which can be 
    used by multiple projects.
--&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Breaking down the problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first cut is somewhat straightforward as we have a piece that deals with
the consumption and manipulation of feeds and another that takes the result
and emits HTML. This is also how the original Planet is put together, with a
library called &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/feedparser/&quot;&gt;feedparser&lt;/a&gt; and another for templating pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the feed-parsing aspect, I can break it down further by considering Atom
and RSS feeds separately and then even further by thinking about how to (1)
consume such feeds and (2) output them. Then there is the HTML component,
where it may be necessary to consider existing representations of HTML. These
are not new ideas and since I'm claiming that individual pieces might be
useful then it's worth finding out which ones are already available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Existing components&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to find existing libraries is via the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://opam.ocaml.org/packages&quot;&gt;OPAM package list&lt;/a&gt;. Some quick searches for &lt;code&gt;RSS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XML&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;HTML&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;net&lt;/code&gt; bring up a lot of packages. The most relevant of these seem to be
&lt;a href=&quot;https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/xmlm/xmlm.1.2.0/&quot;&gt;xmlm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/ocamlrss/ocamlrss.2.2.2/&quot;&gt;ocamlrss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/cow/cow.0.9.1/&quot;&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt; and maybe &lt;a href=&quot;http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/xmldiff/xmldiff.0.1/&quot;&gt;xmldiff&lt;/a&gt;. I noticed that
nothing appears, when searching for &lt;code&gt;Atom&lt;/code&gt;, but I do know that &lt;code&gt;cow&lt;/code&gt; has an
Atom module for creating feeds. In terms of turning feeds into pages and
HTML, I'm aware of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/blob/master/script/rss2html.ml&quot;&gt;rss2html&lt;/a&gt; used on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org&quot;&gt;OCaml&lt;/a&gt; website and parts of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/ocamlnet/ocamlnet.3.7.3/&quot;&gt;ocamlnet&lt;/a&gt; that may be relevant (e.g &lt;code&gt;nethtml&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;netstring&lt;/code&gt;) as well as
&lt;code&gt;cow&lt;/code&gt;.  There is likely to be other code I'm missing but this is useful as a
first pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a number of components are already out there but it's not obvious
if they're compatible (e.g html) and there are still gaps (e.g atom). Since
I also want to minimise dependencies, I'll try and use whatever works but
may ultimately have to roll my own. Either way, I can learn from what
already exists. Perhaps I'm being overconfident but if I can break things
down sensibly and keep the scope constrained then this should be an
achievable project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The first (baby) steps - an Atom parser&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this is an exercise for me to learn OCaml by solving a problem, I need to
break it down into bite-size pieces and take each one at a time. Practically
speaking, this means limiting the scope to be as narrow as possible while
still producing a useful result &lt;em&gt;for me&lt;/em&gt;.  That last part is important as I
have specific needs and it's likely that the first thing I make won't be
particularly interesting for many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my specific use-case, I'm only interested in dealing with Atom feeds as
that's what I use on my site and others I'm involved with. Initial feedback
is that creating an Atom parser will be the bulk of the work and I should
start by defining the types. To keep this manageable, I'm only going to deal
with my own feeds instead of attempting a fully compliant parser (in other
words, I'll only consider the subset of &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287&quot;&gt;RFC4287&lt;/a&gt; that's relevant to me).
Once I can parse, merge and write such feeds I should be able to iterate
from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make my requirements more concrete:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only consider &lt;em&gt;my own&lt;/em&gt; Atom feeds for now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially, be able to parse and emit just one Atom feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then be able to merge 2+ feeds, specifically:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use tag-based feeds from my personal site as starting points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to de-dupe content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No database or storage (construct it afresh every time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimise library dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;!-- 
    Perhaps these requirements are already too much and I may decide to dial
    it down even further (e.g just figure out how to consume *one* feed),
    but I won't really know until I get started. For example, I can imagine
    that I'll need one bunch of code to deal with Atom feeds and then
    perhaps I can make another (feedparser), that depends on it and others
    to deal with general feeds.
--&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Timeframes and workflow&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've honestly no idea how long this might take and I'm treating it as a
side-project. I know there are many people out there who could produce a
working version of everything in a week or two but I'm not one of them (yet).
There are also &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of ancillary things I need to learn on the way, like
packaging, improving my knowledge of Git and dealing with build systems. If
I had to put a vague time frame on this, I'd be thinking in months rather
than weeks.  It might even be the case that others start work on parts of
this and ship things sooner but that's great as I'll probably be able to use
whatever they create and move further along the chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of workflow, everything will be done in the open, warts and all, and
I expect to make embarrassing mistakes as I go. You can follow along on my
freshly created &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amirmc/ocamlatom&quot;&gt;OCaml Atom&lt;/a&gt; repo, and I'll be using the issue tracker as
the main way of dealing with bugs and features. Let the fun begin.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>IoT - Brave New World or Simply evolved M2M?</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I was at an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cambridgewireless.co.uk/events/article/default.aspx?objid=43697&quot;&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; run by Cambridge Wireless today on the Internet of
Things.  These are my notes. Although I've named people, I'm paraphrasing a
lot so best not to treat anything you read here as a direct quote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few audience polls conducted using little keypads they handed
out. There were only 30-ish keypads so it's not necessarily indicative of
how the whole room felt.  I took some hasty pics of a few of the slides
(mainly the poll results) so apologies for the poor quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&quot;The Enterprise and the Internet of Things - Evolution or Revolution?&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Hicklin, Principal Consultant | Commercial Enterprise Markets, CGI UK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, you can walk into the C-suite and start a discussion about the IoT.
They may not know what they're talking about but someone's told them they
need to be thinking about it.  But what is IoT?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the problems in industry you go to your Director and you explain this
new tech and all the awesome things you can do with it and he asks the
dreaded question, &quot;So what?&quot;  Example of the Connected Toothbrush. With a
connected toothbrush you can automatically have a remote relationship with
your dentist.  But he already drives a BMW and it's not clear how he
benefits from that.  He wants you in the office where, every time you open
your mouth, he sees new business development opportunities.  For the moment,
he neither needs nor wants a remote relationship with you. Leads to the
question about who's going to sign up for the business case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of key areas that need to be addressed (paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crack open the Data&lt;/strong&gt;: We are awash with data but don't know how to use
it. Problem with clients is that they really buy into the vision but they
have a lot of legacy systems (green screens!) which already run things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying value&lt;/strong&gt;(?): Volume is not a sign of success.  Need to know
where the value is, which means understanding it. e.g is Enron. Thousands of
documents, accountants all over the place with tons of data. It took a small
team of a few researchers doing a case study that discovered no tax had ever
been paid.  They got to the right data and asked the right questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connectivity&lt;/strong&gt;(?): M2M has grown in a silo'd manner where a device takes
data and sends it to one place.  This needs to open up more and give access
to other areas of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business operations&lt;/strong&gt;: People matter too. Process changes, systems that
allow real-time decisions, empowering individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Overall, IoT is an enabler for a number of wider trends. IoT can improve
operational efficiency &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; enhance customer experience.  Normally these
are in conflict with each-other. However, if we just get into a tech-fest,
then we might just end up with a large number of failures as we've seen with
'Big Data'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poll - Which (categories of) business-related infrastructure categories
are most urgently needed for building the Internet of Things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/cw-iot-new-world/cw-iot-new-world-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Poll results&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&quot;Overcoming the Internet of Things Connectivity Challenge&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Dunn, Software Engineer, Electric Imp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric Imp aims to help people in Product Development in the IoT space,
namely with the connectivity problem.  The name 'IMP' came from 'Internet
Messaging Processor'. Name is also from Terry Pratchett who's stories had
devices that contained an imp which did the work :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building connected devices is difficult. Have to be secure, easy to set up.
There are many choices for connectivity, problems with managing the code on
the devices.  Electric Imp picked wifi and decided to do it well.  This
satisfies a lot of markets but not all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side story of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proofpoint.com/threatinsight/posts/your-fridge-is-full-of-spam-part-ll-details.php&quot;&gt;hacked fridge sending spam emails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things run through Electric Imp system and they manage the security. It's
security as a service.  Electric Imp manages deployment of your code too so
developers can just push code and it will end up on all their devices.&lt;/p&gt;

http://www.proofpoint.com/threatinsight/posts/your-fridge-is-full-of-spam-part-ll-details.php --&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Simplicity comes from one-step setup.  It's optical and uses a smartphone
and flashes the screen, which sends the wifi SSID and credentials to the
device (via a sensor). Customer code runs within a VM on top of with custom
OS (impOS) taking care of I/O (TLS-encrypted wifi connection to service).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficult to debug devices in the field so cloud based- service helps with
that. They do embedded stuff on the device and cloud stuff in the cloud.
There's another VM in the cloud that's paired with the VM on the device.
Heavy lifting can happens elsewhere so no need to parse JSON on the device
itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q - How do you deal with identity of units?&lt;br/&gt;
A - Imps have unique serials and the devices they're plugged into are also unique (missed how).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&quot;Real-life experiences from rolling out M2M networks and how we can learn from these in the shift to IoT&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jon Lewis, Chief Innovation Officer, Plextek Consulting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plextek was working in this field when it was called 'telemetry'.  One of
the earliest things they worked on was 'Lojack' (car tracking). Things then
shifted to 'smart cities' and now people talk about 'IoT' and want consumer
devices with consumer volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2014 has got to be year of IoT. However, still some way from business cases
as it's too expensive to simply track your cat (approx £100 set up fee and
then around £30 pcm).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployment often costs more than then the sensor devices. c.f street
lighting systems.  Choice of radio system is critical.  Projects in
UK/Europe are about incremental cost savings with pay-back in less than 5yrs.
In industrialising countries, there is new build which is easier then
retrofit.  Urbanisation creates strain and demand. Local issues relate to
the Spectrum issues and local regulations (e.g mandate to use govt
encryption streams).  Data privacy is also concern as we don't know who
holds the monkey. That's made even more difficult when you go abroad.  Local
politics also matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big opportunity in B2C: but need consolidation in B2B markets to get
necessary economies of scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big B2B opportunity in developing countries: but is tough and needs local
partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application developers need common platforms: to lower R&amp;amp;D costs and
enable access to global markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whole value chain needs to work: building an ecosystem that connects
application developers to markets is key to achieving scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;&quot;The role of LTE in M2M&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Georg Steimel, Head of M2M Solutions, Huawei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About Huawei
- Three businesses: Carrier network, Consumer business, Enterprise business
- Revenues of $39Bn, No2. Telecom solution provider, 150k+ employees
worldwide&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georg is in Consumer branch for Europe.  Huawei wants to be top M2M module
vendor in the coming years.  They're operator and system integrator agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech evolution brings new opportunities. Mobile data traffic needs, Network
upgrading etc. Ave user expected to generated 1G data traffic per month
(currently 63MB today) and there are predicted to be 50Bn+ devices.
Examples of users are highly varied including monitoring of pregnant cows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges for mass rollout are a scattered market requiring complex
solutions.  Alignment of all parties in one adequate business model is quite
tricky, esp when it comes to customer ownership. Should consider the value
chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complex business model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From sales to service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many stakeholders

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who pays, how much, to whom, for what service, for what benefits?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual benefit must exceed cost

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realistic pricing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appropriate effort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total benefit, direct vs indirect TCO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustainability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Amount of data generated is also going to be huge.  Smart meters in German
households could send over 4TB per day, which is a huge strain for mobile
networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LTE advantage for M2M is obviously bandwidth but that's only relevant to a
few verticals (signage, routers, and in-car entertainment). Low latency is
more important for industrial alarms and medical devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poll - What business models?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/cw-iot-new-world/cw-iot-new-world-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Poll results&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Break down of poll results.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&quot;Using networked visualisation for better decision making&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fredrik Sjostedt, Vice President | Corporate Marketing, Barco Ltd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barco does a lot of visualising information. Displays for radiographers,
stuff in cinema screens, screens in flight simulators and a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need to take in data from sensors, display relevant information and allow
operators to make SMART decisions.  e.g number of CCTV cameras in London -
who's looking at them? Real 'Big Data' step is at the operator level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important to use standards, rather than proprietary systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q - In transport visualisation do you have low enough latency to get
real-time info?&lt;br/&gt;
A- Yes, e.g on a route in Brazil near Sao Palo it's closed dues to fog.
Real-time info important for understanding the whole route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&quot;Regulatory backdrop on IP and standards issues for the M2M eco-system&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Justin Hill, Co-Head of the Patent Prosecution Group and Purvi Parekh, Co-Head of International Telecoms, Olswang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purvi&lt;/strong&gt; on the Regulatory environment&lt;br/&gt;
No tailor made regulation v high regulatory focus. Regulatory focus from
leading bodies and many of them said that existing regulation can be amended
to facilitate M2M/IoT.  Made more complicated by lack of globally agreed
definition of IoT (which make it difficult for lawyers).  There's generally
promotion of Open Standards.  EU does believe that this is v important.
People should read the RAND report (Nov 2013), commissioned by the EU to
examine if there should be standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin&lt;/strong&gt; on IP issues&lt;br/&gt;
With any standardisation process, you're hoping to increase adoption with
the trade-off of Right of IPR owners.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_and_non-discriminatory_licensing&quot;&gt;FRAND&lt;/a&gt; (fair, reasonable, and
non-discriminatory terms) are also important but that's also debatable.
When considering how to protect IPR, it's worth comparing whole-system
claims with protecting at different layers of the tech/value stack and build
a portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&quot;The impact of autonomous systems on surface transport&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paul Copping, Corporate Development Director, TRL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRL is the Transport Research Laboratory.  Did some work to consider the
impact of autonomous transport on the overall value chain.  Some of things
we're trying now with autonomous driving have been successfully done in the
past by other means (e.g car tracking a lane with magnets).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/cw-iot-new-world/cw-iot-new-world-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Transport Value Chain&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&quot;Connected Products - Designing for Scale&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pilgrim Beart, Founder Director, 1248-io&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is IoT?  Humans don't scale.  Population is predicted to tail off at
around 9Bn.  Connected devices are growing and the rate of change is
exponential (and increasing).  In the 90s we used to be our own sysadmin
with maybe one device.  Now we have several and some cloud services.  In the
future there will be many more and they'll have to manage themselves. There
are different problem you face as you go from 1 to 10 to 100 to 10000 to
1MM+ deployed devices.  Issues ranging from device updates al the way to
regulation and externalities that affect your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 10 years time, when all is said and done, we won't be calling it the
Internet of Things. It'll just be called the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q from an application developers perspective wht would you different earlier
in your development if you were to go back and start again&lt;br/&gt;
A - AlertMe started a bit too early so there were a lot things were not
off-the-shelf. Had to build. Right now can see a lot people reinventing the
wheel but shouldn't need to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&quot;A new standard to connect the Internet of Everything&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antony Rix, Senior Consultant, TTP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things TTP works on are wireless standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size of the grey blobs are in an indication of market size.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/cw-iot-new-world/cw-iot-new-world-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IoT Market Segments&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users will expect things to cost pretty much the same as they did before.
Cost will be critical and as we buy things we generally still expect them to
last for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TTP Matrix is a proprietary standard specifically for use by low-cost
wireless connected devices.  It's optimised for efficient use of radio
spectrum, long range, low cost and power efficient.  Use-case example
(DisplayData) are the pricing labels on supermarket.  50k products running
through only 3 gateways (other standards would find this difficult). Low
power consumption means a battery can last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poll - Which (categories of) technical / architecture building blocks are
most urgently needed for building the Internet of Things.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/cw-iot-new-world/cw-iot-new-world-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Poll results&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Debate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting discussion of Humans role in IoT.  For home consumer devices
people may not want to have to make any decisions (completely automated) but
corporates my want all information in order to integrate and decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How quickly will this happen? It's difficult to say when you're in the
middle of it. We'll know it's happened after the event. It takes about a
decade for things to get things in to mature in the market. On the other
hand, it's happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poll - Big and small data - Which statement do you agree with most/least&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;
I only got a pic of the latter but it's the inverse of the former
(unsurprisingly).&lt;br/&gt;

                <title>From Jekyll site to Unikernel in fifty lines of code.</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://openmirage.org&quot;&gt;Mirage&lt;/a&gt; has reached a point where it's possible to easily set up
end-to-end toolchains to build &lt;a href=&quot;http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2566628&quot;&gt;unikernels&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;!--\[If you're not sure what that is, read the post [What is a unikernel?][amc-unikernel]\]--&gt;
My first use-case is to be able to generate a unikernel which can serve my
personal static site but to do it with as much automation as possible. It
turns out this is possible with less than 50 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Jekyll and GitHub Pages at the moment so I wanted a workflow that's as
easy to use, though I'm happy to spend some time up front to set up and
configure things.
The tools for achieving what I want are in good shape so
this post takes the example of a Jekyll site (i.e this one) and goes through
the steps to produce a unikernel on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org&quot;&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt; (a continuous integration service) which can later be
deployed.  Many of these instructions already exist in various forms but
they're collated here to aid this use-case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will take you, dear reader, through the process and when we're finished,
the workflow will be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll write your posts on your local machine as normal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A push to GitHub will trigger a unikernel build for each commit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Xen unikernel will be pushed to a repo for deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, we'll first check that we can build a unikernel VM locally,
then we'll set up a continuous integration service to automatically build
them for us and finally we'll adapt the CI service to also deploy the built
VM.  Although the amount of code required is small, each of these steps is
covered below in some detail.
For simplicity, I'll assume you already have OCaml and Opam
installed -- if not, you can find out how via the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://realworldocaml.org/install&quot;&gt;Real Word OCaml install instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Building locally&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure that the build actually works, you should run things locally at
least once before pushing to Travis.  It's worth noting that the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton&quot;&gt;mirage-skeleton&lt;/a&gt; repo contains a lot of useful, public domain examples
and helpfully, the specific code we need is in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton/tree/master/static_website&quot;&gt;mirage-skeleton/static_website&lt;/a&gt;.  Copy both the &lt;code&gt;config.ml&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;dispatch.ml&lt;/code&gt; files from that folder into a new &lt;code&gt;_mirage&lt;/code&gt; folder in your
jekyll repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;config.ml&lt;/code&gt; so that the two mentions of &lt;code&gt;./htdocs&lt;/code&gt; are replaced with
&lt;code&gt;../_site&lt;/code&gt;.  This is the only change you'll need to make and you should now
be able to build the unikernel with the unix backend.  Make sure you have
the mirage package installed by running &lt;code&gt;$ opam install mirage&lt;/code&gt; and then run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(edit: If you already have &lt;code&gt;mirage&lt;/code&gt;, remember to &lt;code&gt;opam update&lt;/code&gt; to make sure you've got the latest packages.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;_mirage
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;mirage configure --unix
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;make depend         &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# needed as of mirage 1.2 onward&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;mirage build
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ..&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That's all it takes!  In a few minutes there will be a unikernel built on
your system (symlinked as &lt;code&gt;_mirage/mir-www&lt;/code&gt;).  If there are any errors, make
sure that Opam is up to date and that you have the latest version of the
static_website files from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton&quot;&gt;mirage-skeleton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Serving the site locally&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to see this site locally, you can do so from within the
&lt;code&gt;_mirage&lt;/code&gt; folder by running unikernel you just built.  There's more
information about the details of this on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://openmirage.org/wiki/mirage-www&quot;&gt;Mirage docs site&lt;/a&gt;
but the quick instructions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;_mirage
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo mirage run

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# in another terminal window&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sudo ifconfig tap0 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can now point your browser at http://10.0.0.2/ and see your site!
Once you're finished browsing, &lt;code&gt;$ mirage clean&lt;/code&gt; will clear up all the
generated files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the build is working locally, we can set up a continuous integration
system to perform the builds for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting up Travis CI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 10px&quot; src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/jekyll-unikernel/travis.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll be using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org&quot;&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt; service, which is free for open-source
projects (so this assumes you're using a public repo).  The benefit of using
Travis is that you can build a unikernel &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; needing a local OCaml
environment, but it's always quicker to debug things locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Log in to Travis using your GitHub ID which will then trigger a scan of your
repositories.  When this is complete, go to your Travis accounts page and
find the repo you'll be building the unikernel from.  Switch it 'on' and
Travis will automatically set your GitHub post-commit hook and token for you.
That's all you need to do on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you next make a push to your repository, GitHub will inform Travis,
which will then look for a YAML file in the root of the repo called
&lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt;.  That file describes what Travis should do and what the build
matrix is.  Since OCaml is not one of the supported languages, we'll be
writing our build script manually (this is actually easier than it sounds).
First, let's set up the YAML file and then we'll examine the build script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Travis YAML file - .travis.yml&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/#CI-environment-OS&quot;&gt;Travis CI environment&lt;/a&gt; is based on Ubuntu 12.04, with a
number of things pre-installed (e.g Git, networking tools etc).  Travis
doesn't support OCaml (yet) so we'll use the &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; environment to get the
packages we need, specifically, the OCaml compiler, Opam and Mirage. Once
those are set up, our build should run pretty much the same as it did locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, let's keep things simple and only focus on the latest releases
(OCaml 4.01.0 and Opam 1.1.1), which means our build matrix is very simple.
The build instructions will be in the file &lt;code&gt;_mirage/travis.sh&lt;/code&gt;, which we
will move to and trigger from the &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; file.  This means our YAML
file should look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;before_script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;cd _mirage&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;bash -ex travis.sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;MIRAGE_BACKEND=xen DEPLOY=0&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;MIRAGE_BACKEND=unix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The matrix enables us to have parallel builds for different environments and
this one is very simple as it's only building two unikernels. One worker
will build for the Xen backend and another worker will build for the Unix
backend. The &lt;code&gt;_mirage/travis.sh&lt;/code&gt; script will clarify what each of these
environments translates to.  We'll come back to the &lt;code&gt;DEPLOY&lt;/code&gt; flag later on
(it's not necessary yet).  Now that this file is set up, we can work on the
build script itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The build script - travis.sh&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To save time, we'll be using an Ubuntu PPA to quickly get
&lt;a href=&quot;https://launchpad.net/~avsm&quot;&gt;pre-packaged versions of the OCaml compiler and Opam&lt;/a&gt;, so the
first thing to do is define which PPAs each line of the build matrix
corresponds to.  Since we're keeping things simple, we only need one PPA
that has the most recent releases of OCaml and Opam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/env bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ppa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;avsm/ocaml41+opam11
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; sudo add-apt-repository ppa:&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ppa&lt;/span&gt;
sudo apt-get update -qq
sudo apt-get install -qq ocaml ocaml-native-compilers camlp4-extra opam&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;[NB: There are many &lt;a href=&quot;https://launchpad.net/~avsm&quot;&gt;other PPAs&lt;/a&gt; for different combinations of
OCaml/Opam which are useful for testing].  Once the appropriate PPAs have
been set up it's time to initialise Opam and install Mirage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;OPAMYES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;1
opam init
opam install mirage
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;opam config env&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We set &lt;code&gt;OPAMYES=1&lt;/code&gt; to get non-interactive use of Opam (it defaults to 'yes'
for any user input) and if we want full build logs, we could also set
&lt;code&gt;OPAMVERBOSE=1&lt;/code&gt; (I haven't in this example).
The rest should be straight-forward and you'll end up with an
Ubuntu machine with OCaml, Opam and the Mirage package installed.  It's now
trivial to do the next step of actually building the unikernel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;mirage configure --&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$MIRAGE_BACKEND&lt;/span&gt;
mirage build&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can see how we've used the environment variable from the Travis file and
this is where our two parallel builds begin to diverge.  When you've saved
this file, you'll need to change permissions to make it executable by doing
&lt;code&gt;$ chmod +x _mirage/travis.sh&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's all you need to build the unikernel on Travis!  You should now commit
both the YAML file and the build script to the repo and push the changes to
GitHub.  Travis should automatically start your first build and you can
watch the console output online to check that both the Xen and Unix backends
complete properly.  If you notice any errors, you should go back over your
build script and fix it before the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Deploying your unikernel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 10px&quot; src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/jekyll-unikernel/octocat.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Travis has finished its builds it will simply destroy the worker and
all its contents, including the unikernels we just built.  This is perfectly
fine for testing but if we want to also &lt;em&gt;deploy&lt;/em&gt; a unikernel, we need to get
it out of the Travis worker after it's built. In this case, we want to
extract the Xen-based unikernel so that we can later start it on a Xen-based
machine (e.g Amazon, Rackspace or - in our case - a machine on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bytemark.co.uk&quot;&gt;Bytemark&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the unikernel VMs are small (only tens of MB), our method for
exporting will be to commit the Xen unikernel into a repository on GitHub.
It can be retrieved and started later on and keeping the VMs in version
control gives us very effective snapshots (we can roll back the site without
having to rebuild).  This is something that would be much more challenging
if we were using the 'standard' web toolstack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deployment step is a little more complex as we have to send the
Travis worker a private SSH key, which will give it push access to a GitHub
repository.  Of course, we don't want to expose that key by simply adding it
to the Travis file so we have to encrypt it somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sending Travis a private SSH key&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travis supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/&quot;&gt;encrypted environment variables&lt;/a&gt;. Each
repository has its own public key and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubygems.org/gems/travis&quot;&gt;Travis gem&lt;/a&gt; uses
this public key to encrypt data, which you then add to your &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt;
file for decryption by the worker.  This is meant for sending things like
private API tokens and other small amounts of data. Trying to encrypt an SSH
key isn't going to work as it's too large.  Instead we'll use
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/avsm/travis-senv&quot;&gt;travis-senv&lt;/a&gt;, which encodes, encrypts and chunks up the key into smaller
pieces and then reassembles those pieces on the Travis worker.  We still use
the Travis gem to encrypt the pieces to add them to the &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you could give Travis a key that accesses your whole GitHub account, my
preference is to create a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; deploy key, which will only be used for
&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys&quot;&gt;deployment to one repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# make a key pair on your local machine&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/.ssh/
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ssh-keygen -t dsa -C &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;travis.deploy&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; -f travis-deploy_dsa
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note that this is a 1024 bit key so if you decide to use a 2048 bit key,
then be aware that Travis &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/avsm/travis-senv/issues/1&quot;&gt;sometimes has issues&lt;/a&gt;. Now that we have
a key, we can encrypt it and add it to the Travis file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# on your local machine&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# install the necessary components&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;gem install travis
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;opam install travis-senv

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# chunk the key, add to yml file and rm the intermediate&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;travis-senv encrypt ~/.ssh/travis-deploy_dsa _travis_env
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;cat _travis_env &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; travis encrypt -ps --add
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;rm _travis_env&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;travis-senv&lt;/code&gt; encrypts and chunks the key locally on your machine, placing
its output in a file you decide (&lt;code&gt;_travis_env&lt;/code&gt;).  We then take that output
file and pipe it to the &lt;code&gt;travis&lt;/code&gt; ruby gem, asking it to encrypt the input,
treating each line as separate and to be appended (&lt;code&gt;-ps&lt;/code&gt;) and then actually
adding that to the Travis file (&lt;code&gt;--add&lt;/code&gt;).  You can run &lt;code&gt;$ travis encrypt -h&lt;/code&gt;
to understand these options.  Once you've run the above commands,
&lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; will look as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot; data-lang=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;before_script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;cd _mirage&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;bash -ex travis.sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;MIRAGE_BACKEND=xen DEPLOY=0&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;MIRAGE_BACKEND=unix&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;global&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;secure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;encrypted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;....&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;secure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;encrypted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;....&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;secure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;encrypted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;....&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The number of secure variables added depends on the type and size of the key
you had to chunk, so it could vary from 8 up to 29. We'll commit
these additions later on, alongside additions to the build script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we also need to make a repository on GitHub
and add the public deploy key so
that Travis can push to it.  Once you've created your repo and added a
README, follow GitHub's instructions on &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys&quot;&gt;adding deploy keys&lt;/a&gt;
and paste in the public key (i.e. the content of &lt;code&gt;travis-deploy_dsa.pub&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we can securely pass a private SSH key to the worker
and have a repo that the worker can push to, we need to
make additions to the build script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Committing the unikernel to a repository&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we can set &lt;code&gt;DEPLOY=1&lt;/code&gt; in the YAML file we only need to make
additions to the build script.  Specifically, we want to assure that: only
the Xen backend is deployed; only &lt;em&gt;pushes&lt;/em&gt; to the repo result in
deployments, not pull requests (we do still want &lt;em&gt;builds&lt;/em&gt; for pull requests).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the build script (&lt;code&gt;_mirage/travis.sh&lt;/code&gt;), which is being run by the worker,
we'll have to reconstruct the SSH key and configure Git.  In addition,
Travis gives us a set of useful &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/#Environment-variables&quot;&gt;environment variables&lt;/a&gt; so we'll
use the latest commit hash (&lt;code&gt;$TRAVIS_COMMIT&lt;/code&gt;) to name the the VM (which also
helps us trace which commit it was built from).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's easier to consider this section of code at once so I've explained the
details in the comments. This section is what you need to add at the end of
your existing build script (i.e straight after &lt;code&gt;mirage build&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Only deploy if the following conditions are met.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;$MIRAGE_BACKEND&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;xen&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
            -a &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;$DEPLOY&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
            -a &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;$TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# The Travis worker will already have access to the chunks&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# passed in via the yaml file. Now we need to reconstruct &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# the GitHub SSH key from those and set up the config file.&lt;/span&gt;
    opam install travis-senv
    mkdir -p ~/.ssh
    travis-senv decrypt &amp;gt; ~/.ssh/id_dsa &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# This doesn&amp;#39;t expose it&lt;/span&gt;
    chmod &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;600&lt;/span&gt; ~/.ssh/id_dsa             &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Owner can read and write&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Host some_user github.com&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.ssh/config
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;  Hostname github.com&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;          &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.ssh/config
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;  StrictHostKeyChecking no&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;     &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.ssh/config
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;  CheckHostIP no&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;               &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.ssh/config
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;  UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.ssh/config

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Configure the worker&amp;#39;s git details&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# otherwise git actions will fail.&lt;/span&gt;
    git config --global user.email &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;user@example.com&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    git config --global user.name &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Travis Build Bot&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Do the actual work for deployment.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Clone the deployment repo. Notice the user,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# which is the same as in the ~/.ssh/config file.&lt;/span&gt;
    git clone git@some_user:amirmc/www-test-deploy
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;www-test-deploy

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Make a folder named for the commit. &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# If we&amp;#39;re rebuiling a VM from a previous&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# commit, then we need to clear the old one.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Then copy in both the config file and VM.&lt;/span&gt;
    rm -rf &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$TRAVIS_COMMIT&lt;/span&gt;
    mkdir -p &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$TRAVIS_COMMIT&lt;/span&gt;
    cp ../mir-www.xen ../config.ml &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$TRAVIS_COMMIT&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Compress the VM and add a text file to note&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# the commit of the most recently built VM.&lt;/span&gt;
    bzip2 -9 &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$TRAVIS_COMMIT&lt;/span&gt;/mir-www.xen
    git pull --rebase
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$TRAVIS_COMMIT&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; latest    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# update ref to most recent&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Add, commit and push the changes!&lt;/span&gt;
    git add &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$TRAVIS_COMMIT&lt;/span&gt; latest
    git commit -m &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;adding $TRAVIS_COMMIT built for $MIRAGE_BACKEND&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    git push origin master
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Go out and enjoy the Sun!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At this point you should commit the changes to &lt;code&gt;./travis.yml&lt;/code&gt; (don't forget
the deploy flag) and &lt;code&gt;_mirage/travis.sh&lt;/code&gt; and push the changes to GitHub.
Everything else will take place automatically and in a few minutes you will
have a unikernel ready to deploy on top of Xen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see both the complete YAML file and build script in use on my
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amirmc/www-test&quot;&gt;test repo&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/amirmc/www-test&quot;&gt;build logs&lt;/a&gt; for that repo
and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amirmc/www-test-deploy&quot;&gt;deploy repo&lt;/a&gt; with a VM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Pro-tip: If you add &lt;/em&gt;&lt;code&gt;[skip ci]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;em&gt; anywhere in your
commit message, Travis will skip the build for that commit.
This is very useful if you're making minor changes, like updating a
README.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finishing up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I'm still using Jekyll for my website, I made a short script in my
jekyll repository (&lt;code&gt;_deploy-unikernel.sh&lt;/code&gt;) that builds the site, commits the
contents of &lt;code&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; and pushes to GitHub. I simply run this after I've
committed a new blog post and the rest takes care of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/env bash&lt;/span&gt;
jekyll build
git add _site
git commit -m &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;update _site&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
git push origin master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You now have an end-to-end workflow that will produce a
unikernel VM from your Jekyll-based site and push it to a repo.  If you
strip out all the comments, you'll see that we've written less than 50 lines
of code! Admittedly, I'm not counting the 80 or so lines that came for free
in the &lt;code&gt;*.ml&lt;/code&gt; files but that's still pretty impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we still need a machine to take that VM and run it but that's a
topic for another post.  For the time-being, I'm still using GitHub Pages
but once the VM is hosted somewhere, I will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off GitHub Pages and serve from the VM -- but still using Jekyll in
the workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace Jekyll with OCaml-based static-site generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Although all the tools already exist to switch now, I'm taking my time so
that I can easily maintain the code I end up using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Expanding the script for testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that the examples here are not very flexible or
extensible but that was a deliberate choice to keep them readable.  It's
possible to do much more with the build matrix and script, as you can see
from the Travis files on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amirmc/amirmc.github.com/tree/master/_mirage&quot;&gt;website repo&lt;/a&gt;, which were based on
those of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www&quot;&gt;Mirage site&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mor1/mort-www&quot;&gt;Mort's site&lt;/a&gt;.
Specifically, you can note the use of more environment variables and case
statements to decide which PPAs to grab.  Once you've got your builds
working, it's worth improving your scripts to make them more maintainable
and cover the test cases you feel are important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Not just for static sites (surprise!)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed that in very few places in the toolchain above have I
mentioned anything specific to static sites per se.  The workflow is simply
(1) do some stuff locally, (2) push to a continuous integration service
which then (3) builds and deploys a Xen-based unikernel.  Apart from the
convenient folder structure, the specific work to treat this as a static
site lives in the &lt;code&gt;*.ml&lt;/code&gt; files, which I've skipped over for this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the GitHub+Travis workflow we've developed here is quite general
and will apply to almost &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; unikernels that we may want to construct.
I encourage you to explore the examples in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton&quot;&gt;mirage-skeleton&lt;/a&gt; repo and
keep your build script maintainable.  We'll be using it again the next time
we build unikernel devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acknowledgements:&lt;/em&gt; There were lots of things I read over while writing this
post but there were a few particularly useful things that you should look up.
Anil's posts on &lt;a href=&quot;http://anil.recoil.org/2013/09/30/travis-and-ocaml.html&quot;&gt;Testing with Travis&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://anil.recoil.org/2013/10/06/travis-secure-ssh-integration.html&quot;&gt;Travis for secure deployments&lt;/a&gt; are quite succinct (and
were themselves prompted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mlin.net/2013/02/testing-ocaml-projects-on-travis-ci.html&quot;&gt;Mike Lin's Travis post&lt;/a&gt; several
months earlier). Looking over Mort's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mor1/mort-www/blob/master/.travis-build.sh&quot;&gt;build script&lt;/a&gt; and that of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/blob/master/.travis-ci.sh&quot;&gt;mirage-www&lt;/a&gt; helped me figure out the deployment steps as well as improve
my own script. Special thanks also to &lt;a href=&quot;http://erratique.ch&quot;&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lpw25.net&quot;&gt;Leo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://anil.recoil.org&quot;&gt;Anil&lt;/a&gt; for

                <title>Scientific evidence for health supplements</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an update to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/scientific-evidence-for-health-supplements/&quot;&gt;earlier version&lt;/a&gt; of this infographic, which I
came across two years ago.  It was interesting at the time since it did a
good job at displaying the myriad supplements in a way that indicated both
their likely efficacy, according to research papers, and how popular the
search term was.  For example, the previous image showed 'strong' evidence
for licorice root as an aid for coughs, but it had a much smaller search
volume than the equivalently effective fish-oil for blood pressure.  I also
really liked the concept of the 'Worth it Line'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphic has been updated a couple of times now, with the most recent
change a few weeks ago.  There are quite a few differences as garlic didn't
feature so prominently on the previous image and it looks like a number of
things may have been removed (e.g licorice root).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D, as beneficial to general health, is still way up there.  I
decided to try Vitamin D3 supplements over the winter, under the theory that
I'm not getting enough sun so a supplement may be useful.  I was quite
surprised at how much better I felt after a day or so of taking it, to the
point where I tried looking up work on Vitamin D and mood*.  Scanning the
research seemed to indicate that there may be links between Vitamin D,
serotonin levels and depression but the extent isn't clear and conclusions
were mixed.  Of course, that mostly supports what the infographic is saying
and it puts it above the 'Worth it Line' (for depression specifically but
not general 'mood' per se).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to go visit the site as there's an
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/play/snake-oil-supplements/&quot;&gt;interactive version&lt;/a&gt;, where you can highlight a bubble to get more
info and be transported to the main study it references.  If you like, you
can also dig into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/snakeoilsupps&quot;&gt;spreadsheet itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Switching from Bootstrap to Zurb Foundation</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I've just updated my site's HTML/CSS and moved from Twitter Bootstrap to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/features.html&quot;&gt;Zurb Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.  This post captures my subjective notes on the
migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;My use of Bootstrap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I originally set this site up, I didn't know what frameworks existed or
anything more than the basics of dealing with HTML (and barely any CSS).  I
came across Twitter Bootstrap and immediately decided it would Solve All My
Problems.  It really did.  Since then, I've gone through one 'upgrade' with
Bootstrap (from 1.x to 2.x), after which I dutifully ignored all the fixes
and improvements (note that Bootstrap was up to v2.3.2 while I was still
using v2.0.2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/switch-to-foundation/responsive-design.png&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive Design&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, this was fine with me but for a while now, I've been
meaning to make this site 'responsive' (read: not look like crap from a
mobile).  Bootstrap v3 purports to be mobile-first so upgrading would likely
give me what I'm after but v3 is &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/&quot;&gt;not backwards compatible&lt;/a&gt;,
meaning I'd have to rewrite parts of the HTML.  Since this step was
unavoidable, it led me to have another look at front-end frameworks, just to
see if I was missing anything.  This was especially relevant since we'd
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/announcing-new-ocamlorg/&quot;&gt;just released&lt;/a&gt; the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org&quot;&gt;OCaml.org&lt;/a&gt;
website, itself built with Bootstrap v2.3.1 (we'd done the design/templating
work long before v3 was released).  It would be useful to know what else is
out there for any future work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this time I discovered Zurb Foundation and also the numerous
comparisons between them (note: Foundation seems to come out ahead in most
of those).  A few days ago, the folks at Zurb released
&lt;a href=&quot;http://zurb.com/article/1280/foundation-5-blasts-off--2&quot;&gt;version 5&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided that now is the time to kick the
tires.  For the last few days, I've been playing with the framework and in
the end I decided to migrate my site over completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/features.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/switch-to-foundation/zurb-yeti.png&quot; alt=&quot;Foundation's Yeti&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Swapping out one framework for another&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, I've become moderately experienced with HTML/CSS and I can
usually wrangle things to look the way I want, but my solutions aren't
necessarily elegant. I was initially concerned that I'd already munged
things so much that changing anything would be a pain.  When I first put the
styles for this site together, I had to spend quite a bit of time
overwriting Bootstrap's defaults so I was prepared for the same when using
Foundation.  Turns out that I was fine.  I currently use &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; (and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;) so I only had three template files and a couple of
HTML pages to edit and because I'd kept most of my custom CSS in a separate
file, it was literally a case of swapping out one framework for another and
bug-fixing from there onwards.  There's definitely a lesson here in using
automation as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customising the styles was another area of concern but I was pleasantly
surprised to find I needed &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; customisation than with Bootstrap.  This
is likely because I didn't have to override as many defaults (and probably
because I've learned more about CSS since then).  The one thing I seemed to
be missing was a way to deal with code sections, so I just took what
Bootstrap had and copied it in.  At some point I should revisit this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did take me a while to get my head around Foundation's grid but it was
worth it in the end.  The idea is that you should design for small screens
first and then adjust things for larger screens as necessary. There are
several different default sizes which inherit their properties from the size
below, unless you explicitly override them.  I initially screwed this up by
explicitly defining the grid using the &lt;code&gt;small-#&lt;/code&gt; classes, which obviously
looks ridiculous on small screens.  I fixed it by swapping out &lt;code&gt;small-#&lt;/code&gt; for
&lt;code&gt;medium-#&lt;/code&gt; everywhere in the HTML, after which everything looked reasonable.
Items flowed sensibly into a default column for the small screens and looked
acceptable for larger screens and perfectly fine on desktops.  I could do
more styling of the mobile view but I'd already achieved most of what I was
after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Fixing image galleries and embedded content&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only additional thing I used from Bootstrap was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel&quot;&gt;Carousel&lt;/a&gt;. I'd
written some custom helper scripts that would take some images and
thumbnails from a specified folder and produce clickable thumbnails with a
slider underneath.  Foundation provides &lt;a href=&quot;http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/orbit.html&quot;&gt;Orbit&lt;/a&gt;, so I had to spend time
rewriting my script to produce the necessary HTML.  This actually resulted
in cleaner HTML and one of the features I wanted (the ability to link to a
specific image) was available by default in Orbit.  At this point I also
tried to make the output look better for the case where JavaScript is
disabled (in essence, each image is just displayed as a list).  Below is an
example of an image gallery, taken from a previous post, when I
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/joined-the-computer-lab/&quot;&gt;joined the computer lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;
  &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The gallery needs JavaScript but I've tried to make it degrade gracefully. -Amir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Foundation also provides a component called &lt;a href=&quot;http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/flex_video.html&quot;&gt;Flex Video&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the
browser to scale videos to the appropriate size.  This fix was as simple as
going back through old posts and wrapping anything that was &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in a
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;flex-video&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  It really was that simple and all the Vimeo and
YouTube items scaled perfectly.  Here's an example of a video from an
earlier post, where I gave a &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/&quot;&gt;walkthrough of the ocaml.org site&lt;/a&gt;.
Try changing the width of your browser window to see it scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-video widescreen vimeo&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/61768157?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=de9e6a&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen=&quot;true&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; allowFullScreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Video demo&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Framework differences&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of the main difference between the two frameworks is that Bootstrap
uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesscss.org&quot;&gt;LESS&lt;/a&gt; to manage its CSS whereas Foundation uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com&quot;&gt;SASS&lt;/a&gt;.  Frankly,
I've no experience with either of them so it makes little difference to me.
It's worth bearing in mind for anyone who's workflow does involve
pre-processing.  Also, Bootstrap is available under the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#license-faqs&quot;&gt;Apache 2 License&lt;/a&gt;, while Foundation is released under
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/faq.html#question-3&quot;&gt;MIT license&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the transition was pretty painless and most of the time was spent
getting familiar with the grid, hunting for docs/examples and trying to make
the image gallery work the way I wanted.  I do think Bootstrap's docs are
better but Foundation's aren't bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this isn't meant to be a comparison, I much prefer Foundation to
Bootstrap.  If you're not sure which to use then I think the secret is in
the names of the frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bootstrap (for me) was a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; way to '&lt;em&gt;bootstrap&lt;/em&gt;' a site quickly with
lots of acceptable defaults -- it was quick to get started but took some
work to alter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foundation seems to provide a great '&lt;em&gt;foundation&lt;/em&gt;' on which to create more
customised sites -- it's more flexible but needs more upfront thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much how I'd recommend them to people now.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Announcing the new OCaml.org</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;As some of you may have noticed, the new OCaml.org site is now live!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DNS may still be propagating so if &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org&quot;&gt;http://ocaml.org&lt;/a&gt; hasn't updated for you then try http://166.78.252.20.  This post is in two parts: the first is the announcement and the second is a call for content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New OCaml.org website design!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new site represents a major milestone in the continuing growth of the OCaml ecosystem. It's the culmination of a lot of volunteer work over the last several months and I'd specifically like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Chris00&quot;&gt;Christophe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ashishagarwal.org&quot;&gt;Ashish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://philippewang.info/CL/&quot;&gt;Philippe&lt;/a&gt; for their dedication (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/commits/master&quot;&gt;commit logs&lt;/a&gt; speak volumes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/ann-new-ocamlorg/ocaml-home-wire.png&quot; alt=&quot;OCaml.org Wireframes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began this journey just over 8 months ago with paper, pencils and a lot of ideas. This led to a comprehensive set of &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/&quot;&gt;wireframes and walk-throughs&lt;/a&gt; of the site, which then developed into a collection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Site-Redesign&quot;&gt;Photoshop mockups&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, these formed the basis for the html templates and style sheets, which we've adapted to fit our needs across the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the design process, we also considered the kind of structure and &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/infrastructure/2013-July/000211.html&quot;&gt;workflow we aspired to&lt;/a&gt;, both as maintainers and contributors.  This led us to develop completely new tools for &lt;a href=&quot;http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-09-05-22-31-26-about-omd.html&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-10-03-20-35-12-using-mpp-two-different-ways.html&quot;&gt;templating&lt;/a&gt; in OCaml, which are now available in OPAM for the benefit all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on all these things in parallel definitely had it challenges (which I'll write about separately) but the result has been worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/images/ann-new-ocamlorg/ocaml-home-mockup.png&quot; alt=&quot;OCaml.org&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey is ongoing and we still have many more improvements we hope to make. The site you see today primarily improves upon the design, structure and workflows but in time, we also intend to incorporate more information on packages and documentation. With the new tooling, moving the website forward will become much easier and I hope that more members of the community become involved in the generation and curation of content.  This brings me to the second part of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Call for content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have lots of great content on the website but there are parts that could do with a refresh and gaps that could be filled.  As a community driven site, we need ongoing contributions to ensure that the site best reflects its members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you do commercial work on OCaml then maybe you'd like to add yourself to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org/community/support.html&quot;&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt;? Perhaps there are tutorials you can help to complete, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html&quot;&gt;99 problems&lt;/a&gt;?  If you're not sure where to begin, there are already a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues?labels=content&quot;&gt;content issues&lt;/a&gt; you could contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we've gone through a bug-hunt already, feedback on the site is still very welcome.  You can either &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues&quot;&gt;create an issue&lt;/a&gt; on the tracker (preferred), or email the infrastructure list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's fantastic how far we've come and I look forward to the next phase!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Migration plan for the OCaml.org redesign</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;We're close to releasing the new design of ocaml.org but need help from the
OCaml community to identify and fix bugs before we switch next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashish, Christophe, Philippe and I have been discussing how we should go
about this and below is the plan for migration.  If anyone would like to
discuss any of this, then the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure&quot;&gt;infrastructure list&lt;/a&gt; is the best
place to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've made a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/tree/redesign&quot;&gt;new branch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the main ocaml.org repository with
the redesign.  This branch is a fork of the master and we've simply cleaned
up and replayed our git commits there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've built a live version of the new site, which is visible at
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://preview.ocaml.org&quot;&gt;http://preview.ocaml.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - this is rebuilt every few minutes
from the branch mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of one week, we ask the community to review the new site
and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues&quot;&gt;report any bugs or problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the issue tracker. We &lt;em&gt;triage&lt;/em&gt;
those bugs to identify any blockers and work on those first.  This is the
phase we'll be in from &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one week (7 days), and after blocking bugs have been fixed, we
&lt;strong&gt;merge the redesign branch&lt;/strong&gt; into the master branch.  This would
effectively present the new site to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;During the above, we would not be able to accept any new pull requests on
the master branch but would be happy to accept them on the new, redesign
branch.  Hence, restricting the time frame to one week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that the above is only intended to merge the &lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;toolchain&lt;/em&gt; for the new site.  Specifically, we've created new landing
pages, have new style sheets and have restructured the site's contents as
well as made some new libraries (&lt;a href=&quot;http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-09-05-22-31-26-about-omd.html&quot;&gt;OMD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pw374.github.io/posts/2013-10-03-20-39-07-OPAMaging-MPP.html&quot;&gt;MPP&lt;/a&gt;). The new toolchain
means people can write files in markdown, which makes contributing content a
lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the files are on GitHub, people don't even need to clone the site
locally to make simple edits (or even add new pages). Just click the 'Edit
this page' link in the footer to be taken to the right file in the
repository and GitHub's editing and pull request features will allow you to
make changes and submit updates, all from within your browser (see the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-files-in-your-repository&quot;&gt;GitHub Article&lt;/a&gt; for details).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still work to be done on adding new features but the above changes
are already a great improvement to the site and are ready to be reviewed by
the OCaml community and merged.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Review of the OCaml FPDays tutorial</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fpdays.net/2013/sessions/index.php?session=24&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 10px&quot; src=&quot;/images/web/fpdays-logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Last Thursday a bunch of us from the OCaml Labs team gave an OCaml tutorial
at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fpdays.net/2013/sessions/index.php?session=24&quot;&gt;FPDays&lt;/a&gt; conference (an event for people interested in Functional
Programming).  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yallop&quot;&gt;Jeremy&lt;/a&gt; and I led the session with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lpw25.net&quot;&gt;Leo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dsheets&quot;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://philippewang.info/CL/&quot;&gt;Philippe&lt;/a&gt; helping everyone progress and dealing with questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 10px&quot; src=&quot;/images/fpdays2013/fpdays2013-01.jpg&quot;&gt;
It turned out to be by far the &lt;em&gt;most popular session&lt;/em&gt; at the conference with
over 20 people all wanting to get to grips with OCaml!  An excellent turnout
and a great indicator of the interest that's out there, especially when you
offer a hands-on session to people.  This shouldn't be a surprise as we've
had good attendance for the general &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-NonDysFunctional-Programmers/&quot;&gt;OCaml meetups&lt;/a&gt; I've run
and also the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocamllabs.github.io/compiler-hacking/2013/09/17/compiler-hacking-july-2013.html&quot;&gt;compiler hacking sessions&lt;/a&gt;, which Jeremy and
Leo have been building up (do sign up if you're interested in either of
those!).  We had a nice surprise for attendees, which were
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley_proof&quot;&gt;uncorrected proof&lt;/a&gt; copies of Real World OCaml and luckily, we had just
enough to go around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the tutorial itself, Jeremy put together a nice sequence of exercises
and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocamllabs/fpdays-skeleton&quot;&gt;skeleton repo&lt;/a&gt; (with helpful comments in the code) so that people
could dive in quickly.  The event was set up to be really informal and the
rough plan was as following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Installation/Intro&lt;/em&gt; - We checked that people had been able to follow the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/fpdays-ocaml-session/&quot;&gt;installation instructions&lt;/a&gt;, which we'd sent them in advance.
We also handed out copies of the book and made sure folks were comfortable
with &lt;a href=&quot;http://opam.ocaml.org&quot;&gt;OPAM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello world&lt;/em&gt; - A light intro to get people familiar with the OCaml
syntax and installing packages with OPAM. This would also help people to get
familiar with the toolchain, workflow and compilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monty Hall browser game&lt;/em&gt; - Using &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;js_of_ocaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we wanted
people to create and run the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem&quot;&gt;Monty Hall problem&lt;/a&gt; in their
browser.  This would give people a taste of some real world interaction by
having to deal with the DOM and interfaces.  If folks did well, they could
add code to keep logs of the game results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Client-server game&lt;/em&gt; - The previous game was all in the browser (so could
be examined by players) so here the task was to split it into a client and
server, ensuring the two stay in sync.  This would demonstrate the
re-usability of the OCaml code already written and give people a feel for
client server interactions. If people wanted to do more, they could use
&lt;a href=&quot;http://opam.ocaml.org/pkg/ctypes/0.1.1/&quot;&gt;ctypes&lt;/a&gt; and get better random numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We did manage to stick to the overall scheme as above and we think this is a
great base from which to improve future tutorials.  It has the really nice
benefit of having visual, interactive elements and the ability to run things
both in the browser as well as on the server is a great way to show the
versatility of OCaml.  &lt;code&gt;js_of_ocaml&lt;/code&gt; is quite a mature tool and so it's
no surprise that it's also used by companies such as Facebook (see the recent
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKWNjFagR9k&quot;&gt;CUFP talk by Julien Verlaguet&lt;/a&gt; - skip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=gKWNjFagR9k#t=1149&quot;&gt;19:00&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned a lot from running this session so we've captured the good, the
bad and the ugly below.  This is useful for anyone who'd like to run an
OCaml tutorial in the future and also for us to be aware of the next
time we do this.  I've incorporated the feedback from the attendees as well
as our own thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fpdays2013/fpdays2013-03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Heads down and hands on&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Things we learnt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Good&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people really did follow the install instructions beforehand. This
made things so much easier on the day as we didn't have to worry about
compile times and people getting bored.  A few people had even got in touch
with me the night before to sort out installation problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many folks from OCaml Labs also came over to help people, which meant
no-one was waiting longer than around 10 seconds before getting help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had a good plan of the things we wanted to cover but we were happy to
be flexible and made it clear the aim was to get right into it.  Several
folks told us that they really appreciated this loose (as opposed to rigid)
structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn't spend any time lecturing the room but instead got people right
into the code.  Having enough of a skeleton to get something interesting
working was a big plus in this regard. People did progress from the early
examples to the later ones fairly well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had a VM with the correct set up that we could log people into if they
were having trouble locally.  Two people made use of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, It was great to have early proofs of the book and these were
well-received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fpdays2013/fpdays2013-02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RWO books galore!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bad&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our excitement to get right into the exercises, we didn't really give
an overview of OCaml and its benefits.  A few minutes at the beginning would
be enough and it's important so that people can leave with a few sound-bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone received my email about installation, and certainly not the
late arrivals.  This meant some pain getting things downloaded and running
especially due to the wifi (see 'Ugly' below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few of the people who &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; installed, didn't complete the instructions
fully but didn't realise this until the morning of the session.  There was a good
suggestion about having some kind of test to run that would check
everything, so you'd know if there was something missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We really should have had a cut-off where we told people to use VMs
instead of fixing installation issues and 10-15 minutes would have been
enough.  This would have been especially useful for the late-comers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn't really keep a record of the problems folks were having so we
can't now go back and fix underlying issues.  To be fair, this would have
been a little awkward to do ad-hoc but in hindsight, it's a good thing to
plan for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;The Ugly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only ugly part was the wifi.  It turned out that the room itself was a
bit of a dead-spot and that wasn't helped by 30ish devices trying to connect
to one access point!  Having everyone grab packages at the same time in the
morning probably didn't help.  It was especially tricky as all our
mitigation plans seemed to revolve around at least having local connectivity.
In any case, this problem only lasted for the morning session and was a
little better by the afternoon.  I'd definitely recommend a backup plan in
the case of complete wifi failure next time!  One such plan that Leo got
started on was to put the repository and other information onto a flash
drive that could be shared with people.  We didn't need this in the end but
it'll be useful to have something like this prepared for next time.  If
anyone fancies donating a bunch of flash drives, I'll happily receive them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a great session and everyone left happy, having completed
most of the tutorial (and with a book!).  A few even continued at home
afterwards and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richardclegg/status/393458073052139520&quot;&gt;got in touch&lt;/a&gt; to let us know that they got
everything working.
It was a great session and thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarkDalgarno&quot;&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JacquiDDavidson&quot;&gt;Jacqui&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of
the FPDays crew for a great conference!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>FP Days OCaml Session</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yallop&quot;&gt;Jeremy&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lpw25.net&quot;&gt;Leo&lt;/a&gt;, I'll be running an OCaml Hands-on Session at
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fpdays.net/2013/&quot;&gt;FPDays conference&lt;/a&gt;. Below are some prep
instructions for attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Preparation for the session&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're starting from scratch, installation can take some time so it's
best to get as much done in advance as possible.  You'll need OPAM (the
package manager), OCaml 4.01 (available through OPAM) and a few libraries
before Thursday.  If you have any issues, please contact Amir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPAM&lt;/strong&gt;: Follow the instructions for your platform at &lt;a href=&quot;http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Quick_Install.html&quot;&gt;http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Quick_Install.html&lt;/a&gt;.
OPAM requires OCaml so hopefully the relevant dependencies will kick in and
you'll get OCaml too (most likely version 3.12).  You can get a cup of
coffee while you wait. After installation, run &lt;code&gt;opam init&lt;/code&gt; to initialise OPAM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OCaml 4.01&lt;/strong&gt;: We actually need the latest version of OCaml but OPAM
makes this easy.  Just run the following (and get more coffee):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;opam update
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;opam switch 4.01.0
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;eval&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;opam config env&lt;span class=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libraries&lt;/strong&gt;: For the workshop you will need to check that you have the
following installed: &lt;code&gt;libffi&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pcre&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pkg-config&lt;/code&gt;.  This will depend on
your platform so on a Mac with homebrew I would do
&lt;code&gt;brew install libffi pcre pkg-config&lt;/code&gt; or on Debian or Ubuntu
&lt;code&gt;apt-get install libffi-dev&lt;/code&gt;.  After this, two OCaml packages it's worth
installing in advance are &lt;code&gt;core&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;js_of_ocaml&lt;/code&gt; so simply run:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;opam install core js_of_ocaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;OPAM will take care of the dependencies and the rest we can get on the day!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The real problem of humanity</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I heard this today.  It made me stop and think so I decided to look it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The real problem of humanity is the following:
we have paleolithic emotions; medieval institutions;
and god-like technology.
And it is terrifically dangerous,
and it is now approaching a point of crisis overall.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Feedback requested on the OCaml.org redesign</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a work-in-progress site at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml-redesign.github.io&quot;&gt;ocaml-redesign.github.io&lt;/a&gt;, where we've
been developing both the tools and design for the new ocaml.org pages.  This
allows us to test our tools and fix issues before we consider merging
changes upstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a more detailed post coming about all the design work to date and
the workflow we're using, but in the meantime, feedback on the following
areas would be most welcome.  Please leave feedback in the form of issues on
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocamllabs/sandbox-ocaml.org/issues&quot;&gt;ocaml.org sandbox repo&lt;/a&gt;.  You can also raise points on the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure&quot;&gt;infrastructure mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OCaml Logo&lt;/strong&gt; - There was some feedback on the last iteration of the
logo, especially regarding the font, so there are now several options to
consider.  Please look at the images on the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Draft-OCaml-Logos&quot;&gt;ocaml.org GitHub wiki&lt;/a&gt; and then leave your feedback on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocamllabs/sandbox-ocaml.org/issues/16&quot;&gt;issue #16 on the sandbox repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Site design&lt;/strong&gt; - Please do give feedback on the design and any glitches
you notice. Text on each of the new landing pages is still an initial draft
so comments and improvements there are also welcome (specifically: Home
Page, Learn, Documentation, Platform, Community). There are already a few
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocamllabs/sandbox-ocaml.org/issues&quot;&gt;known issues&lt;/a&gt;, so do
add your comments to those threads first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

                <title>I'm working on The Internet of *my* Things</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time I've been interested what the future holds in terms of how
we will interact with each other and our environments.  Back in the day,
these areas used to be called ubiquitous computing and home automation but
have since been subsumed by the (only slightly) catchier moniker of Internet
of Things (IoT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/mjwiacek/3718366706/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 10px&quot; src=&quot;/images/web/pizza-oven.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
A couple of my ideas involved controlling devices at home via SMS messages
(this was way before smart phones and 'apps' came along).  For example,
being able to set my VCR to record a show while I'm out* or pre-heat the
oven when I'm heading home with a frozen pizza&lt;sup&gt;&amp;dagger;&lt;/sup&gt;.  Of
course, if I were to implement these now I'd take a completely different
approach.  With all the advances we've made, the Internet of Things has huge
potential to change our lives the way the Internet itself did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if we take the last decade of the Internet and Web as an example of
how the IoT may play out it's actually not a pretty picture.  We're in the
age of the Internet behemoths, with huge centralised data silos containing
lots of our personal data.  We trust such services to secure our data but
&lt;a href=&quot;http://venturebeat.com/2012/08/01/dropbox-has-become-problem-child-of-cloud-security/&quot;&gt;repeated breaches&lt;/a&gt; undermine that trust. Sure, there is
some choice among providers but it's fast becoming a case of &quot;choose your
dictator&quot;.  Our information is trapped, interoperating is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/google-abandons-open-standards-instant-messaging&quot;&gt;becoming difficult&lt;/a&gt; and to top it off, these giants are
busy fighting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20130523150909464&quot;&gt;legal battles&lt;/a&gt; with each other instead of
out-competing.  Users just get caught in the cross-fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we extrapolate this to the Internet of Things then, ultimately, it'll
become a winner-take-all-my-data arrangement, with lock-ins to restrict me
from migrating.  Remember, we're talking about connecting more devices to
the Internet and giving almost ubiquitous access to our daily lives and
habits.  Trading more of our personal lives, from within our homes, with
increasingly faceless companies and for not very much in return, isn't
particularly appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/59937401@N07/5857192377/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:left; margin-right: 15px;&quot; src=&quot;/images/web/monopoly-house-die-dollar.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
If the IoT plays out this way, then we will effectively &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; the
Privacy Tax that we've &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; had to pay for our social networking tools.
In order to benefit from the world of connected devices, we have to adjust
(again) the notion of ownership.  I want this to be the Internet of &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt;
Things, so how do we make that happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To really achieve that, we need to have software infrastructure that
incorporates &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_Design&quot;&gt;Privacy by Design&lt;/a&gt;, so that an individual can regain the
ability to control their data and decide for themselves whom to share it
with. These infrastructure tools must also work in a distributed fashion, so
there's no requirement to ally yourself to any particular centralised
service. Of course, the tools themselves also have to be open-source, so
that developers can be reassured that the ground they're building their
products on won't be taken away from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year and a half, I've been exploring these ideas at the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk&quot;&gt;Cambridge Computer Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.  A lot of cutting edge work is being done
on the problems of &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org/connected-devices-and-signpost&quot;&gt;Identity and connectivity&lt;/a&gt; as well as the
operating systems for the future.  Infrastructure and tools are being shaped
that together form a new toolstack to make the creation and management of
decentralised networks easier&lt;sup&gt;&amp;Dagger;&lt;/sup&gt;.  There's a larger picture
emerging from this work and it's time to start talking more about it and
describing the pieces.  We're calling this open-source toolstack
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org&quot;&gt;Nymote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and there's a new site where you can read more about it and
keep up with news and releases.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org/blog/2013/introducing-nymote/&quot;&gt;introductory post&lt;/a&gt;
there describes more about the background and what we're working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be writing about this work both here and on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymote.org/blog&quot;&gt;Nymote Blog&lt;/a&gt; and I'd
love to hear from others who are interested in this area -- please do
&lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;get in touch with me&lt;/a&gt; or leave a comment.  If you'd like to sign up
for updates by email, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://eepurl.com/mXYb1&quot;&gt;join the Nymote list here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- footnotes --&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;* Sky+ came out with this feature a few months after I started discussing it with people.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;dagger;&lt;/sup&gt; Yes, people told me this was insane and I'd burn my house down.  Luckily for my housemates, I never actually got around to implementing anything.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;Dagger;&lt;/sup&gt; This is somewhat ironic as decentralisation was one of the founding tenets of the Internet. We're just helping people get back to that.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Wireframe demos for OCaml.org</title>
                <description>&lt;h3&gt;Making mockups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, I've been working on various aspects of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org&quot;&gt;OCaml.org&lt;/a&gt; design project.  This covers things like the design, information architecture and how to incorporate new functionality.  One of the methods for thinking through these was to put together a bunch of wireframes using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.balsamiq.com&quot;&gt;Balsamiq&lt;/a&gt; and use these to express (and generate) ideas as well as get feedback quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven't used wireframes before, think of them as a slightly more advanced form of sketching things out on a whiteboard.  The best aspect is that it's far quicker, easier and &lt;em&gt;cheaper&lt;/em&gt; to iterate using wireframes than on an actual website.  As you'll see below, you can also convey a lot of information about how a site might work by showing people a clickable demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to make this work public and I thought the best way would be to show you some screencasts of how the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://ocaml.org&quot;&gt;OCaml.org&lt;/a&gt; website might work and also make the demo available to all of you.  The three videos below cover three aspects of the site and I'd encourage you to go through them in order (about 16 minutes in total).  Apologies if my screen isn't particularly clear in the videos but you can visit the demo for yourself and see things in more detail (link and info on feedback at the end of this post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Video walkthroughs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who'd like to watch the videos back-to-back and scaled to fit your browser window, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/couchmode/album/2301640&quot;&gt;view the Vimeo album in 'couchmode'&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, individual videos are embedded below (total time 16m17s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Public wireframe demo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A demo you can interact with can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocaml.mybalsamiq.com/projects/public-demo/naked/0_home?key=b897ea86d8a8199c6e46b3295ddf630dfa33e5e1&quot;&gt;OCaml.org wireframe demo&lt;/a&gt; and image files for each page are available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Wireframes&quot;&gt;github ocaml.org wiki&lt;/a&gt;.  Please bear in mind the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everything that looks like it might be clickable actually is (and vice versa). There'll be a toggle on the bottom right of the browser window that will highlight what can be clicked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are parts of the site which are 'work in progress' and are marked as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The designs you see aren't necessarily final. Your feedback will help shape our decisions and the best way to provide it is via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure&quot;&gt;infrastructure mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

                <title>OCaml - Installation and hello world</title>
                <description>

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;This post is part of a series where I'm trying to teach myself OCaml.&lt;br /&gt;
You might want to &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/thirty-days-of-ocaml/&quot;&gt;start at the beginning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's been a few days into my OCaml experience so this is a write-up of what I've come across so far.  I've spent more time reading background rather than getting stuck in so I've copied in some of the links that I've found interesting/useful at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are number of ways you can get OCaml on your machine.  The most obvious  would be to get the source via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/release.en.html&quot;&gt;release page&lt;/a&gt;, but you could also use something called &lt;a href=&quot;http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/index.html&quot;&gt;GODI&lt;/a&gt;, which apparently bundles a bunch of other stuff alongside the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't really want to install from source 'by hand' and I definitely don't need all the stuff that comes with GODI.  I happen to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; on my machine, so I checked to see if I can install that way.  Turns out I can, so that's what I ended up doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;brew install objective-caml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The current version of OCaml is 4.00.0 and you can check the version you have installed by typing &lt;code&gt;ocaml -version&lt;/code&gt; in your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware that Homebrew has it's own installation process and depends on Ruby.  To get Ruby, someone recommended that I install via &lt;a href=&quot;https://rvm.io/&quot;&gt;Ruby Version Manager&lt;/a&gt;.  To be able to do the above, you'll need to have the OSX developer tools installed, which means having &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/xcode/&quot;&gt;Xcode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program&quot;&gt;hello world&lt;/a&gt; programme working.  Since OCaml is a compiled language, that means writing the necessary source code into a file, compiling it and then executing it.  In this case I only need one line that prints 'hello world' to the screen and I'm taking it from INRIA's site (&lt;a href=&quot;http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/u3-ocaml/ocaml-steps.html&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ocaml&quot; data-lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hello, world!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Take the one line above and save it in a file called &lt;code&gt;hello.ml&lt;/code&gt;.  Now we need to compile that file using the OCaml compiler.  At the command prompt, type the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;ocamlc -o hello hello.ml
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;./hello&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Since I don't really understand the first line I should break it down. &lt;code&gt;ocamlc&lt;/code&gt; is the command to invoke the compiler, the option &lt;code&gt;-o hello&lt;/code&gt; means you want to name the output executable to be (in this case) 'hello' and the final argument is the source code file.  It's useful to look at the man page for &lt;code&gt;ocamlc&lt;/code&gt; to see what other options are available.  The second line executes the programme, which prints hello world to the screen with a line-break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also notice that I now have two other files in addition to the source, &lt;code&gt;hello.cmi&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hello.cmo&lt;/code&gt;.  According to the man page, these are the 'compiled interface' and 'compiled object code file' respectively.  I have no idea what that means but removing the files doesn't affect the executable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;OCaml 'toplevel'&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though OCaml is a compiled language, there's something called 'toplevel' that allows interactive use (more on &lt;a href=&quot;http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual023.html&quot;&gt;toplevel&lt;/a&gt;).  To enter this mode, you simply have to type &lt;code&gt;ocaml&lt;/code&gt; at the prompt so let's try running the above hello world program using toplevel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;$ ocaml
        OCaml version 4.00.0

# print_string &amp;quot;Hello, world!\n&amp;quot;;;
Hello, world!
- : unit = ()
# #quit;;
$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; prompt is the command line and the &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; prompt is where toplevel is awaiting a new line of input.  The input can span multiple lines and is terminated by &lt;code&gt;;;&lt;/code&gt; (as in the source code).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To exit toplevel, type &lt;code&gt;#quit;;&lt;/code&gt;.  It took me three attempts to get that right.  I haven't really played around with toplevel much and I think I'm likely to stick with source code and compiling until I'm a little more comfortable with the syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's pretty much where I am for the moment and everything so far has been straightforward.  Obviously, I should push myself a bit harder :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the material I found and have been looking over for the last couple of days.  Useful as background but I'd say I'm in danger of (semi-productive) procrastination if I'm not careful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

                <title>Thirty Days of OCaml</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeremyandchanel/6131620285/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ocaml-30days/camel-bactrian-silhouette.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bactrian Camel Silhouette&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've set myself a challenge that over the next thirty days, I'll teach myself some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming&quot;&gt;functional programming&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml&quot;&gt;OCaml&lt;/a&gt;.  This will be my first experience of FP in addition to learning a new language so I expect it'll be quite challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I go along, I'll try and write regular posts -- hopefully one a day -- describing my experiences and frustrations as well as the questions that occur to me.  I suspect a number of the posts might be summaries to help me organise my understanding, especially where things seem unexpected.  For the times where I can formulate well-posed questions, I'll put them up in places like &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ocaml&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; as well as describing them here.  Either way, keeping some form of diary will be useful for me and maybe also for other folks who've considered trying out FP and OCaml in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I'm not completely new to programming but I would say I have any deep experience (especially compared to the folks I tend to hang out with). Just to give you a better picture, my coding experience so far has involved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some C/C++ with a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming&quot;&gt;OOP&lt;/a&gt; programming for a High Energy Physics simulation (during my undergrad - a long time ago so I've forgotten everything)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/&quot;&gt;Matlab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)&quot;&gt;Bash&lt;/a&gt; scripting for analysis of neuroimaging data (during my PhD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications&quot;&gt;VBA&lt;/a&gt; within MS Excel for analysing behavioural data (also during my PhD -- I really wish someone had pointed me to Python back then)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://learnpythonthehardway.org&quot;&gt;Learn Python the Hard Way&lt;/a&gt; (I keep dipping in and out of this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I tried to dump most of my old scripts -- at least those I could find -- into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amirmc/PhD_stuff&quot;&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt;, but I still haven't collated the Matlab bits.  You can judge my coding skills for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the 30 days, I'm hoping to have the ability to pick up and read other people's OCaml code and write basic stuff for myself.  I don't actually have a particular project in mind but I'm not going to let that be an excuse for &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll post again tomorrow with the mundane parts of how to get things installed and running on a Mac*.  Onward!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*Admittedly, I already did this some time ago but I want this series of posts to start right from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>I'm in San Francisco (and later NYC)</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Actually, I've been here for a while now and feeling (mostly) settled in.  I'm in the US for another couple of months, most of which will be in SF, with a short trip to Colorado and New York thrown in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I've met a bunch of folks from 'back home', people that they know, and a handful of new ones.  While I'm out here, I'm hoping to meet a lot more people who might be interested in the work we're doing in the Lab.  Specifically things related to Software Defined Networking, Identity and Functional Programming -- basically anything that overlaps with projects like &lt;a href=&quot;http://perscon.net/overview/signpost.html&quot;&gt;Signpost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openmirage.org/&quot;&gt;Mirage&lt;/a&gt; (if you happen to know anyone, bonus points for putting me in touch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also managed to get out of town, courtesy of friends-with-a-car, and saw the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/&quot;&gt;Monterey Aquarium&lt;/a&gt; (some pics below).  Not been hiking yet but will hopefully make it out of town again at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, SF is a very interesting place and I can see the draw for people to come here.  Although a lot of the companies are further south, there's much more 'stuff' happening here.  I'm looking forward to the next couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure where this came from but it's interesting (e.g I had no idea that Nestle did pet food nor that they had a stake in L'Oreal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a month ago I was at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tedxgranta.com/&quot;&gt;TEDx Granta&lt;/a&gt;.  The theme was Alive &amp;amp; Kicking and it was a good event with some really interesting speakers, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eben Upton, on the Raspberry Pi Foundation (pic 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merlin Crossingham, on Wallace &amp;amp; Gromit (pics 5&amp;amp;6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tim Minshall, on how engineers make the future (pic 9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Videos will be on the website at some point for those who want to catchup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also another TED event taking place in June. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tedxoxbridge.com/&quot;&gt;TEDx Oxbridge&lt;/a&gt;, organised by students from Oxford and Cambridge, will be on the theme of Unconventional Wisdom.  Not sure who the speakers are yet.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>More likely to die Dancing than Skydiving</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;From the infographic below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Odds of dying while skydiving in the US: 1 in 101,083&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Dance parties: 1 in 100,000 chance of dying&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonder what the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcpa.org.uk/&quot;&gt;BCPA&lt;/a&gt; would make of this, since they recklessly combine both Skydiving &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; parties on a regular basis (how extreme).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously though, this nicely depicts that many things have &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; odds than skydiving (although comparisons like this should be taken with a pinch of salt).  However, base jumping (which is not the same thing as skydiving) seems to be the most dangerous by far (1 in 60).&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Joining the Computer Lab Systems Group</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;This was the post I &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to write all the way back in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've joined the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/netos/&quot;&gt;Systems Research Group&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;Cambridge Computer Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.  Much of the work here has a strong practical angle and people like to build useful things.  Several of the profs here have been involved in creating some prominent companies (one recent example is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xensource.com&quot;&gt;XenSource&lt;/a&gt;, which powers much of the public cloud - bought by Citrix).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work in the lab is related to &lt;a href=&quot;http://perscon.net/&quot;&gt;Personal Containers&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to give users access and control over their lifelong digital footprint.  It's part of a wider research program funded by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.horizon.ac.uk/Horizon-Research&quot;&gt;Horizon Digital Economy Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, which tackles topics ranging from energy efficiency to &quot;Death 2.0&quot; (that might sound odd but what &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; happens to your online identity/ies when you die? What &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; happen? How?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I worked on was a paper with several other folks in the lab, which is currently being presented at a conference.  It's about infrastructure to infer the carbon footprint of employees' daily commute by analysing high resolution geolocation data from their smartphones.  Obviously, this must be done in a privacy-sensitive manner, which is what the paper discusses.  Once it's published in the conference proceedings I'll add a link to it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also been writing a bit on the Personal Conatainer's blog about privacy and personal data.  The posts there will be reposted here too, over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, here are some random pics from the lab.  The second pic will make more sense if you've seen the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/242/&quot;&gt;xkcd comic&lt;/a&gt; it's based on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                <title>I moved my site to GitHub Pages</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Yet again, it's been several months since my last post (it's almost a habit now).  This isn't intended to be another catchup post, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this post is that I've moved my site (&lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com&quot;&gt;amirchaudhry.com&lt;/a&gt;) to &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I'm using my own domain, this is unlikely to affect anyone but I've copied this post into both the new GitHub site and old Posterous site just in case.  If you're reading this via &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirmc.posterous.com&quot;&gt;my Posterous site&lt;/a&gt; (presumably through the share/follow features there), then it'll be the last post to go up there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still a bunch of things that are bit broken in the new place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No tweet/sharing buttons*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tags don't sort properly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search doesn't work well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSS/Atom feed is probably a mess&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syntax highlighting isn't working**&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Moving from Posterous to GitHub Pages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of moving to GitHub was a useful experience.  Here are the steps I ended up taking before I pointed the domain to the new site. Overall, I'm really glad that my posts aren't tied up in someone else's platform anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Getting set up with GitHub Pages&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; and the default &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/&quot;&gt;bootstrap theme&lt;/a&gt;. It was &lt;em&gt;ridiculously&lt;/em&gt; quick and easy to get a basic site up and start playing around.  The first thing I did was try to re-create structure of my old site and then worry about how it looked.  I'd never dealt with CSS before so this was always going to take a while. For example, it took me &lt;em&gt;ages&lt;/em&gt; to figure out why items kept shifting between pages. Turns out I needed the following line in my style file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;overflow-y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;scroll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Although dealing with the CSS took a while, Bootstrap made it really easy to copy/paste/edit the bits I wanted to change.  The nav section was a pain to sort out.  It took a few weeks to get to this point but you're looking at a bootstrap site, which looks nothing like bootstrap (win!). It's likely that I'll keep tweaking things but I'm not expecting to do anything major.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Migrating the posts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn't an easy way to migrate directly from Posterous to GitHub. There are scripts available but either through bad-luck or ineptitude, I couldn't get them to work.  A guy called &lt;a href=&quot;http://jazzychad.net/&quot;&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt; recently created &lt;a href=&quot;http://exportmyposts.com&quot;&gt;Export My Posts&lt;/a&gt;, which pulled out all my content in html format (phew!).  I really didn't want to deal with learning an API or parsing an xml file, so I'm glad he put this together.  It works extremely well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step was to run all the html posts through &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc&quot;&gt;pandoc&lt;/a&gt; to convert them to markdown. I wrote a fairly trivial shell script to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; -e &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Files to convert to md? &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt; -a allfiles
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#args=(&amp;quot;$@&amp;quot;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; file in &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;allfiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[*]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;   %s\n&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$file&lt;/span&gt;
    pandoc -o ./convert/&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$file&lt;/span&gt;.md &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then came the slow process of checking each file, removing the left-over html, adding the appropriate headers, dealing with image galleries etc.  Part of this could have been automated but I don't have that many posts so I went through them manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all that was done, I simply had to switch the domain over and everything was fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to keep a local copy of content. Of course, this is now solved but even before-hand I would write and save things locally before sending them up. The problem was that I'd always have to tweak something or edit a typo and &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; changes happened on the site (never on my local copy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having existing things I can dig into and copy from (i.e. bootstrap) really speeds up my learning. I don't think I could have gotten this far this quickly without such resources.  If you look at the code itself it's probably a mess, but it's &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scripting things will help. Quickly creating image galleries is the next thing I need to figure out. The process is obvious to me now (since I did parts of it by hand) but I have to automate it using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imagemagick.org&quot;&gt;ImageMagick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'm quite pleased with myself.  I've gone from knowing nothing about CSS, static sites, and bootstrap to being vaguely (in)competent. Rock on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*Though I'll probably use something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addthis.com&quot;&gt;AddThis&lt;/a&gt;. ... Edit: Ok, so at the time of writing, I didn't have the buttons but by the time of publishing I'd figured it out :)&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;**Yup, managed to fix that too :)&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Long overdue catchup post</title>
                <description>

&lt;!-- permalink: http://amirchaudhry.com/catchup-post-oct-dec --&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;aka 'highlights of the last few months'&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been quite a while since I posted anything and it's time I did.  The last few months have been pretty busy so I thought I'd write some notes about the main items in one post and then we can pretend that I'm current again.  I'm well aware that the sheer size of this post means it's unlikely to be read fully by most people.  There are some pics so perhaps that might be enough to hold your interest :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later this week, I'll write a separate post about the things I'm working on now and I'll try to keep more up to date from then onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the following covers October to December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Silicon Valley comes to the UK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.svc2uk.com&quot;&gt;SVc2UK&lt;/a&gt; was a 5/6 day conference with events taking place in Cambridge and London.  The aim is to introduce students from universities to high-profile folks from the Valley and inspire the students to consider startups as a career path (either by founding or joining them).  I was involved in this conference back in 2009 and decided to join the the new team for the 2011 events.  This year the conference was preceded by a several 'Appathons' (read: hackathons), which took place at 6 Universities, including Cambridge.  You can find out more about the Appathon and the conference via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.svc2uk.com&quot;&gt;svc2uk.com&lt;/a&gt; but here are some short notes and some pics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;-- Cambridge Appathon --&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hackathons were 2-day events aimed at students and the theme was open government data.  I ran the Cambridge event on behalf of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cue.org.uk&quot;&gt;Cambridge University Entrepreneurs&lt;/a&gt; and we had about 80 people taking part over the course of the weekend.  Representatives from Google, Facebook, Apple and the Technology Strategy Board were present to advise the student teams and folks from the local tech community also got involved.  At the end of the weekend, we awarded Amazon Kindles to three winning teams (as decided by audience vote) and everyone was encouraged to enter the national competition too.  One of the Cambridge teams also won the national prize (a trip to SV).  Yeay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the sheer amount of brain-ache involved, I could (should?) write a separate post on how to run a hackathon.  Maybe I'll get around to it at some point but in the meantime, here's the team that actually pulled this together: &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/~mabotinc/index.html&quot;&gt;Matko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~arb33/&quot;&gt;Alistair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~acr31/&quot;&gt;Andy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/benfwirtz&quot;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/ivanmazour&quot;&gt;Ivan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/simofeja&quot;&gt;Simona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saardrimer.com/&quot;&gt;Saar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/roger-coulston/26/598/7a1&quot;&gt;Roger&lt;/a&gt;.  I'm also especially grateful to the sponsors/supporters of the event: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.red-gate.com/&quot;&gt;Red Gate Software&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cocoacontrols.com/&quot;&gt;Cocoa Controls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/106738482735452735039/posts&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt; (at Google), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.svc2uk.com&quot;&gt;SVc2UK&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;Cambridge Computer Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; (who hosted us for a weekend).  Below are some pictures of the event itself and the national awards ceremony at Downing Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;-- SVc2C Conference --&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the main part of the conference and the guests from the Valley were in Cambridge for two days.  In that time, they took part in a pretty large number of events and hopefully met a lot of interesting students.  If you're interested in the list of guests, you can check them out via the link on the conference website (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.svc2uk.com&quot;&gt;svc2uk.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find videos of this year's sessions on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/user5407037&quot;&gt;Vimeo account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Stanford online courses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did all three of the inaugural classes. Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Databases ... and I enjoyed them in that order.  The following is a short summary/review of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ml-class.org/&quot;&gt;ML-Class&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was fantastic since you had to write actual scripts and I really looked forward to both the videos and exercises every week.  At times, the exercises felt a bit contrived (one line of code in a file) but there were occasions where I had to really think properly to &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; that one line.  Once you got the hang of matrix multiplication the exercises got easier.  The scores don't really mean anything since you could repeat the questions until you got a perfect score. At some point, I'll go back over the iTunes U content from the profs 2008 class.  It has more theory/maths and covers reinforcement learning, which the applied course didn't.  You can find my 'programming' exercises &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amirmc/ai-ml-classes&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ai-class.com/&quot;&gt;AI-Class&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was a very different course and it didn't seem as 'slick' as the ML class but I learnt &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more maths, specifically about probability.  Since I was terrible at probability at school, I really wanted to get a better handle on it and this class really made me work.  I have pages and pages of calculations for some of the in-class questions and I hope I can retain what I've learnt.  At times there was only a cursory overview of a topic before moving on but I should have expected that from an &quot;Intro to...&quot; course.  This was the only class with &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; graded homeworks and exams. Overall, I was in the 'top 25%' according the statement I got (overall mark was 95%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.db-class.org&quot;&gt;DB-Class&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was the one I least understood but the one I originally thought I was going to stick with.  Within the first few lectures, I knew I was going to find it tough.  Relational Algebra made no sense to me and the videos seemed to cover each example once and move on to something else.  Since I didn't have enough time to find additional resources, I ended up barely following along and basically flunked the course.  There was a mid-term and final exam and the homeworks could be repeated until you got a perfect score (but I ended up not bothering).  No idea what score I got but you needed &gt;50% to get a statement and I didn't get one :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I was very impressed by the dedication and effort the profs and the teams working with them put into the courses.  Although the profs were the folks centre stage, there were a group of largely unsung heroes who kept things running, put together exercises and enabled everything to happen.  This method of learning is really going to take off and if people can figure out how to deal with proper certification, then it might even challenge the notion of going to University.  There have been a slew of new courses available and I think I'll try two more if I can fit them in (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pgm-class.org/&quot;&gt;Probabilistic Graphical Models&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.modelthinker-class.org/&quot;&gt;Model Thinking&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Learning to code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've also been trying to keep up with learning Python via &lt;a href=&quot;http://learnpythonthehardway.org/&quot;&gt;LPtHW&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/amirmc/TheHardWay&quot;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; for progress).   I'd describe myself as chugging along and I'm glad that I'm not finding anything too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trickiest part is finding ways to actually fit some coding into things I need done.  Since I finished analysing my PhD data, I've not had the need to write scripts or manipulate data in any substantive way and I don't fancy re-writing any of my old stuff (NB I also tried to collate all of that and added it to GitHub too).  I'm sure I can find something worth doing and I suspect it might involve Django sooner than I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also signed up to Code Academy's 'Code Year' but I've not opened any of their emails yet (and I suspect I won't have time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/web/lpthwbook.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Learn Python the Hard Way&quot; alt=&quot;LPtHW&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Events and occasional startup stuff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always there have been a bunch of events and startup-related items in the last few months.  Normally I wouldn't bother mentioning these but I'm in a list-y mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great graphic. I'm surprised to see Vitamins A &amp;amp; E so far down the list though.&lt;/p&gt;

A possible reason that the &quot;tangible health benefits&quot; of Vitamins A &amp;amp; E is low is that a &quot;healthy diet&quot; (mentioned at the top of the graphic) already includes enough of those nutrients, and consuming extra vitamins above the required level does not confer extra health benefits. Also: hello! How do? ;-) &lt;/p&gt;

                <title>My thoughts on the Seedsummit Term Sheet</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/web/seedsummit-termsheet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Affärsbilder by Dan Eriksson on Flickr&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, &lt;a href=&quot;http://seedsummit.org&quot;&gt;Seedsummit&lt;/a&gt; released a Term
Sheet intended to be (or become) standard across Europe for early stage
investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been several days since the announcement and so far I haven’t seen
much in-depth commentary on it (other than acknowledging its existence
and how difficult it must have been to achieve consensus). That might be
because the announcement seemed to come as a surprise, so perhaps folks
haven’t had a chance to digest it yet. Or maybe nobody cares?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/pda/2011/jul/06/startups-terms-seed&quot;&gt;One post from the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; offered some criticism, but beyond that it’s all been a bit quiet. Since no-one else has posted any thoughts, I thought I’d go through the document and offer my opinions. I’ve put the notes in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/review-of-the-seedsummit-term-sheet&quot;&gt;more comprehensive post&lt;/a&gt; and summarised the main points here (mostly because going through a legal document is a little bit dreary).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Main comments on Seedsummit term sheet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few of things that founders should be careful of. First is
the liquidation preference, where founders should be getting the
non-participating option (Option 1). Second is vesting, since founders
probably want to adjust the values described. Third is how the option
pool is set up (before/after the funding). Finally, the anti-dilution
provisions don’t seem to provide any useful information so founders
should check this carefully if they’re presented with it. For more
detail on any of these points, see the relevant section in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/review-of-the-seedsummit-term-sheet&quot;&gt;detailed
review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall impression I got was that these are documents for &lt;strong&gt;dealing
with VCs&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(edit: It seems an additional note was added to the download
page to this effect)&lt;/em&gt;. Unsurprising since it was put together by 21 VC
firms from across Europe. Surprising because I’m guessing no Angel
investors were involved, despite the term sheet being advertised for
‘early stage’ financing. Since Seedsummit is trying to build a network
of european investors (and credit to them for that), I did find it a
little odd that there didn’t seem to be any Angels listed as helping to
create this document. Perhaps it’s because the Angels aren’t investing
on a pan-european basis? I’d love to see a Series A term sheet for
comparison and my gut feel is that the Seedsummit document has a lot
more in common with Series A than with Angel docs. This does beg the
question, what does ‘seed’ actually mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What does &lt;em&gt;seed&lt;/em&gt; mean?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, I set up and ran the first iteration of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.springboard.com&quot;&gt;Springboard&lt;/a&gt; (a seed accelerator). We were
helping early-stage teams to get a product out the door and to start
getting feedback from users (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/venturehacks/customer-development-methodology-presentation&quot;&gt;customer development&lt;/a&gt;).
When teams came out of the programme, I considered them ‘seed-stage’,
i.e likely to be ready for seed investment, wherever that may come from.
Ideally, the team would have a version of the product that was being
used by early adopters. The team would be adapting that product based on
feedback, although they would likely have little/no revenue. That
basically sums up what I picture in my head when I think of
‘seed-stage’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last week I’ve met several VCs from different firms and asked
them directly what &lt;em&gt;seed&lt;/em&gt; means to them. For each of them, seed-stage
investing involves companies that have a product, customers and
revenues. This was pretty much the case for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the VCs I spoke to. I
wish I’d probed for more detail as to what kind of revenue/customer
numbers they expect but never mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, despite using the same language, there’s obviously a gap
between the above viewpoints. I’m not suggesting either of them is right
or wrong but I think it’s important to point out such differences,
especially in the light of the new ‘standard’ term sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What does this term sheet mean for founders?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In brief, founders should do their homework. In going through this
document, I spent quite a while researching and there’s actually a lot
of information out there about what the terms mean and the impact they
might have. As we now have a European VC term sheet in the open it’ll
make comparisons with US VCs a lot easier. Any major disparities will
quickly be picked on by the popular startups who might go elsewhere to
raise money. Indeed, the real test will be whether or not a ‘hot’ new
startup uses these terms and as they stand, I doubt that will be the
case. Founders will still need lawyers and VCs will still be willing to
negotiate terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not quite at the point-and-click stage for early stage financing
but with more and more information being put into the open, it does
become easier for startups to make better informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Review of the Seedsummit Term Sheet</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/my-thoughts-on-the-seedsummit-term-sheet&quot;&gt;summary post&lt;/a&gt; (above) before reading this one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary: Last week, &lt;a href=&quot;http://seedsummit.org&quot;&gt;Seedsummit&lt;/a&gt; released a Term
Sheet intended to be (or become) standard across Europe for early stage
investment. To achieve this, 21 European VC firms convened and agreed on
a ‘standard’ set of terms. The aim of producing this document is to make
“… seed funding easier to access, better to understand, and fair for all
parties”. If you want to, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seedcamp.com/docs/seedsummit_general_termsheet_v1p.doc&quot;&gt;download the general term sheet&lt;/a&gt;
for yourself. I’ll go through this document below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Things to note&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get into the document itself, there are a few things I should
point out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most important is that &lt;strong&gt;I Am Not A Lawyer&lt;/strong&gt;. Anyone dealing
with &lt;em&gt;legal docs&lt;/em&gt; should obviously get &lt;em&gt;legal advice&lt;/em&gt;. However,
since this term sheet is meant to be “reader-friendly” (as
SeedSummit says), I’d hope that someone like myself should be able
to understand and interpret it to some degree. If not, one of the
benefits of this document diminishes since I still need a lawyer to
translate it for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m only reviewing the general term sheet, not the EIS specific
sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve read typical angel investment docs since I’ve led one angel
investment before (for someone else). Hence my point of view is
likely to be influenced by that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve never seen a term sheet from a VC so I can’t make any specific
comparisons between the new SeedSummit sheet or a prior VC term
sheet (though I’d like to).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously, everything you read is here is just my opinion. Whether
you agree or disagree, I just want to see some discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About Seedsummit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realised I know very little about Seedsummit itself so I looked around
their website and also for other links via Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few words, SeedSummit is Europe’s answer to
&lt;a href=&quot;http://angel.co/&quot;&gt;AngelList&lt;/a&gt;. More specifically, it’s SeedCamp’s answer
to AngelList (it’s run by the same people rather than independently). It
seems there are about 120-ish investors (assuming all profiles are
visible) and the investment range is from 10k to 500k EUR (which is the
kind of range I consider to be ‘seed’). Randomly clicking through the
profiles, I see that the majority of them say “I am investing: My own
money”. At first, I took that to mean there were more Angels on the
platform but looking closer I noticed that some of those profiles are of
Partners in VC funds. Although these folks have ‘skin in the game’ I
expect they only invest via their funds so it would have been more
appropriate to say “Money from a fund”. In any case, this made it more
tricky to guess at the ratio between Angels and VCs on Seedsummit, so I
gave up trying. If anyone else knows the answer, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Comments on the Seedsummit Term Sheet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll go through this term by term and note my comments so you can follow
along with the document. I’ll skip the stuff that doesn’t warrant much
discussion (e.g Company, Founders, etc). Since this document was based
on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seriesseed.com/&quot;&gt;Series Seed&lt;/a&gt; documents from the US,
I’ll also make a quick comparison between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Structure of financing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/114.asp&quot;&gt;pre-money&lt;/a&gt;
valuation includes the employee share option pool, which effectively
dilutes the founders a little more than they would otherwise have
expected. There’s a pretty good post by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/11/valuation-and-option-pool.html&quot;&gt;Fred Wilson on valuations and option pools&lt;/a&gt;
and I’d recommend people read that for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Type of security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This basically says that the new shares have preferential rights (i.e
they are not common stock).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Liquidation preferences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two options here and both state “… one times the original
purchase price …”, in other words it’s the same amount of money the
investor put in. Had this been anything other than ‘one’ it would be
cause for concern. The main difference between the two options is
whether the investor is &lt;em&gt;non-participating&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;fully-participating&lt;/em&gt;
which are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Non-participating&lt;/em&gt; means that the investor can do one of two things
when there’s a ‘liquidity event’ (e.g acquisition). They can either make
sure they get their money back (i.e one times the purchase price), with
any left over being divided amongst the other shareholders. Or they can
choose to get an amount in proportion to the shares they hold. They will
take whichever returns the most money. Obviously, both the founder and
investor want the sale to be as large as possible so both will be aiming
for the latter case. In the case where the exit isn’t quite what the
investor imagined, then they’ll try and get their money back. It seems
there is an example of this in practice when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/08/heres-why-you-need-a-liquidation-preference.html&quot;&gt;Fred wrote about Slide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fully-participating&lt;/em&gt; means the investor gets to do &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; of the
above. They will get their money out first and then will &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; take a
share of any left over money (sometimes referred to as
‘double-dipping’). This is definitely the less founder-friendly option
and I expect founders would not accept it (assuming they have enough
bargaining power to push back). It does seem a little odd to me that
this is listed as an option in an early stage term sheet, especially
since terms usually get carried forward into subsequent funding rounds.
For an example of how liquidation preferences can affect the way money
gets distributed, you can read &lt;a href=&quot;http://venturebeat.com/2010/08/16/beware-the-trappings-of-liquidation-preference/&quot;&gt;VentureBeat on liquidation preferences&lt;/a&gt;
(scroll down to the example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Anti-dilution provisions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This term, which is indicated as optional, dictates what happens if a
subsequent round of funding occurs at a lower valuation than the current
one. Except it doesn’t. Those deceptive square brackets could hold a
range of scary sounding words and in some cases you might even find
equations in there. Since there’s no suggested text here, I don’t have
much to say. Feel free to google and you’ll find some variations on what
could end up in here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Important Decisions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A list of things you can’t do without the investor’s consent. The
options here basically whether the list is written in the terms or
referred to in an appendix. From the suggested list, there isn’t
anything I haven’t seen before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that might be &lt;em&gt;missing&lt;/em&gt; is the proportion of shares that must
be maintained by these investors to maintain this right. As it stands,
the investor could hold any amount of shares and still maintain the
right (e.g they could hold less than 5% and still block a sale of the
company even if the other 95+% agreed to it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pre-emption, Right of first-refusal and Co-sale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen most of this before but there are a couple of things I don’t
understand. Firstly, for pre-emption, “The Investors my assign this
right to another member of their fund group”. I have no idea what this
means since I can’t figure what ‘fund group’ is being referred to.
Secondly, for the Right of first-refusal, I’m not sure what “…transfers
by Investors to affiliated funds” means either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Drag Along&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important point here is that &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; a majority of the Preference
shares &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; of the Ordinary shares is required to enact it. Had it only
been a majority of Preference shares then it would be drastically
one-sided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Restrictive Covenants and Founders Undertakings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other documents come into play here, for example the employment
contracts. An interesting point is that the founders shouldn’t work on
anything else during their ‘business time’, which mean any side projects
might need permission from the investors. It’s reasonable to expect
founders to commit themselves to the business but they would need to
check the employment contract to make sure there isn’t anything
untoward. The last sentence referring to immediate dismissal for cause
seems a little harsh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Founder Shares&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the shares held by founders would be subject to &lt;em&gt;reverse
vesting&lt;/em&gt;. In effect, whatever shares you thought you ‘owned’, you don’t
really have anymore. Reverse vesting means that although you have your
shares the company will repurchase them from you (at practically no
cost) if you leave or are fired. That ‘right-to-repurchase’ diminishes
over time. This doesn’t sound like a good deal for the founders but it’s
understandable that the investor wants to keep the founders committed to
the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting part are the suggested figures. 25% of the founder
shares vest after a year and the rest on a monthly basis over another
two years. This seems a bit excessive to me. Firstly, I don’t see any
reason why more of the shares can’t vest immediately and the rest on a
monthly basis thereafter. Secondly, I think a three year time frame is
quite long and although I’ve seen it for employee options it doesn’t
seem appropriate for founders at an early stage. (edit to add: I’ve
heard from friends in San Francisco that four year vesting with a one
year cliff is pretty standard out there)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the kinds of startups I’ve dealt with, I’m generally of the opinion
that if a founder leaves, then the company is effectively over.
Provisions for clawing back shares, like the one one here, seem largely
pointless to me. In any case, I think founders will have to look
carefully at what the vesting looks like and see if it works for them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Expenses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 1 just plain sucks. I find it slightly ridiculous that the
investor expects the company to pay for their legal fees and the amount
isn’t even capped. Option 2 is slightly better in that everyone pays
their own fees but it also includes a caveat that if the founders decide
to withdraw, then they’ll have to pay the investor’s legal fees to date.
That would seem fair enough but notice there’s no caveat for the case
where the &lt;em&gt;investor&lt;/em&gt; decides to change their mind. I’d certainly push
for that to be added too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Brief comparison with Series Seed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Seedsummit term sheet is itself based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seriesseed.com/&quot;&gt;Series Seed&lt;/a&gt; documents so I thought it would make
sense to do a quick comparison between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a handful of things I noticed which were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Series seed only mentions a non-participating liquidation preference
(Seedsummit includes an option for fully participating)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Series Seed document, the investor’s legal expenses are paid
for by the company but they’re capped ($10,000).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Series Seed’s founder vesting is over 4 years (but gives no
suggestions).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No anti-dilution provisions in Series Seed term sheet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you got this far then congratulations on your patience!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Did Google+ Hangout just kill Skype?</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/singles//google-plus.png&quot; alt=&quot;google-plus&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disclaimer: I still haven't tried Hangout, not enough people in my
circles yet.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skype has been great for conference calls and video calls but it's
nearly always been a hassle with more than 2 people. It's analogous to
the way in which phones work i.e great when only two people need to talk
but confusing to set up if there are more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it's different, Hangout might obviate the need to use Skype
video again. Having multiple people, with cameras, all in one 'room' and
effectively with one-click sounds fantastic. Of course, I haven't tried
it yet but I can imagine not needing to use Skype video again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skype will still have it's place (for now) since I find it useful to see
who's online and ask quick questions via IM. However, even that benefit
might disappear in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm curious to know what other people think.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I just spent the afternoon &lt;del&gt;playing&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;doing valuable research&lt;/em&gt; with Lego.
The pics above show my amazing creation but they don't do justice to the
complexity of it. I really didn't think I'd need the instructions but I
was so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was actually part of a research study that will be done with 4-5
year old children. Essentially, the kids will be asked to follow
instructions to build objects and the researchers are interested in the
self-regulatory processes during constructive play ... woosh ... Me play
with Lego. Me happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the bus above is considered too complex, which doesn't
surprise me since it took me a few hours to put it together. Most of
that time was spent rummaging around in the box for the right parts
(that's part of the study design). I didn't help myself by deciding part
way through that I wanted it to be a right-hand drive bus instead of the
left-hand drive that the instructions described (you might be able to
spot the difference between pics 2 and 3). That was fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lego itself is pretty interesting and there are some really strict
tolerances required in its manufacture. If you've ever played with Lego,
consider the following: the pieces are held together only by friction,
yet you can create and dismantle fairly large and robust objects; if you
build a wall of Lego, the plane of that wall is pretty smooth (no
protruding bricks). If you're manufacturing millions of these little
things, you can only achieve that with some damn precise engineering.
Apparently the moulds are made within a tolerance of 2 micrometers. For
comparison, the width of a human hair ranges from 17-180 micrometers.
It's even more impressive when you consider that bricks from 1958 are
still compatible with bricks made today.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Richard Stallman on Free Software and your Freedom (lecture)</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Lecture at Cambridge Computer Lab on 1 March 2011 - Sponsored by
Software East (@markdalgarno)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[pls excuse the typos &amp;amp; poor grammar. I'm typing this on the fly and
unlikely to edit it before posting. Caveat emptor]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[edit: It was a long talk and I missed some chunks. Overall, he spoke
for just over 90mins. Longer than I was expecting]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio: Richard Stallman launched the development of the GNU operating system (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org&quot;&gt;www.gnu.org&lt;/a&gt;) in 1984. GNU is free software: everyone has the freedom to copy it and redistribute it, as well as to make changes either large or small. The GNU/Linux system, basically the GNU operating system with Linux added, is used on tens of millions of computers today. Stallman has received the ACM Grace Hopper Award, a MacArthur Foundation fellowship, the Electrical Frontier Foundation's Pioneer Award, and the Takeda Award for Social/Economic Betterment, as well as several honorary doctorates. &lt;br /&gt;
[taken from: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theiet.org/local/emea/europe/switzerland/stallman-2010.cfm&quot;&gt;http://www.theiet.org/local/emea/europe/switzerland/stallman-2010.cfm&lt;/a&gt; see his website at stallman.org]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stallman enters room and hush descends immediately. Cue joke about slides and &quot;definitely not PowerPoint&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is free software? It sw that respects your freedom. Think of free speech not free beer. A non free sw is digital colonization. It acts to divide and conquer people&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A program is free if you have 4 freedoms &lt;br /&gt;
0 - To run it as you wish &lt;br /&gt;
1 - Have source to edit to run as you wish &lt;br /&gt;
2 - To share &amp;amp; distribute &amp;amp; help others, as you wish &lt;br /&gt;
3 - To distribute modified, copies if you wish&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If sw does not obey these then it's unethical. Notice that these are not
about the technical issues. The difference is an ethical, social and
political distinction. The use of propriety sw is a social problem and
we should aim to eliminate the problem. ie eliminate propriety sw. Goal
of free sw is to make all sw free so that users are free. If you use a
program without freedom 2 then you end up in a moral dilemma. If someone
says &quot;Hey, great sw. Can I get a copy?&quot;. In this case you should choose
lesser of two evils, which is to violate the license and give your
friend a copy. Being the lesser evil doesn't mean it's good though. When
you've fully studied this dilemma what should you do? Option 1: don't
have any friends! That what the proprietary debs would have you do.
Option 2: don't have that sw in the first place so you don't end up in
the dilemma in the first place. Note on Piracy: They attack ships. With
arms. Freedom 0 - Essential so you can control your computing. No one
else should have that control. Only you. There are proprietary programs
that have licenses that restrict your freedom of speech (ie website
software that means you cannot publish stuff disparaging to sw vendor)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freedom 1 - Being a victim of malicious sw is something that ppl are
subject to all the time. For example back-doors, DRM, spyware,
handcuffs. The sw is not there to serve you but is actually a prison
guard. Eg in MSFT sw can install stuff on pc w/out user consent or
knowledge. Once windows has installed then it's no longer your machine.
Apple is no better. They've even stolen the ability to install apps.
They don't even agree w free sw. Also a back-door by which Apple can
delete sw installed on users machine. Even apps exist that detect
Jailbreak and refuse to operate. All these are Malware. Products
include: Apple iMoan, Apple iBad, Amazon Swindle - &quot;Kindle was conceived
to burn books.&quot; (riffs on Amazon taking books off devices etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if devs of proprietary sw are good, they're human and make errors.
ie bugs. Without freedom 1 you are a prisoner. Freedom 1 isn't enough.
There too much sw and plenty of non-devs cannot edit it. That's why we
need Freedom 3. To contribute to your community and spread benefits.
Without this freedom what a waste it would be for people to write
changes over and over. Every user can take part in Freedom 0 and 2 since
it doesn't require any programming knowledge. Freedom 1 and 3 allow
those who can to make improvements. With free software. Support is a
free-market since everyone can study the code and master it. Hence
people can get better support. Since support for proprietary sw is a
monopoly, the support sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four freedoms together give us democracy. These are sufficient for
people to have control over the sw. Without these the sw controls the
ppl. Launched free software foundation in 1983. All operating systems
were proprietary hence ppl immediately lost freedom when they had to
install an OS. This was an injustice. As an OS developer, he could write
the OS and then legally make it free. At the time, the free sw movement
had no enemies at the time. Mostly because ppl thought the job was so
big that it couldn't get done. Following the basic design of UNIX made
sense. Then I gave it a name which was a joke. [digs in bag]. GNU = Gnu
Not Unix. (riffs on the name and pronunciation). History of Linux.
Aside: What is a free sw license? Why do we need them? &lt;br /&gt;
Copyright law automatically limits anything that's written so you have
to explicitly grant the four freedoms. Even then there are distinctions.
Eg copy-left licenses and non copy-left licenses. Specifically, user has
to pass on the freedoms that have been passed on to him (copy-left).
Torvalds made the Linux Kernel free under the GNU license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name matters. Linux does not have the same views on 'free' as GNU.
Yet people using Linux think that most of the ideas came from Torvalds
rather than GNU. Debate on Human Rights has continued for centuries. Yet
the debate on free/proprietary sw has only gone on for about 20yrs.
Therefore the debate on what human rights are applicable to sw have only
involved the devs, who obviously have said &quot;none&quot;. Another problem. Now
ppl have another term: Open-Source. The ideas that surround this didn't
include the ethical aspects of 'free'. Easy to lose freedom if you don't
fight for it. There are now distros that contain proprietary sw and are
no longer free. Free distros can be found at gnu.org/distros. Why did
all this happen? &lt;br /&gt;
Because the idea of freedom wasn't important to people. They didn't
appreciate it. We have to teach ppl to value freedom and demand it. Our
greatest scarcity in FSF is not ppl to write sw but ppl to fight for the
idea of freedoms. Freedom is now different since JavaScript in browsers
means that things get installed in browser without your knowledge.
'Like' buttons even track ppl that don't use Facebook. Ppl need to be
educated. Even SaaS is becoming pervasive and is worse than proprietary
since the data goes elsewhere. There's no remedy for this, other than
not to use it. Only a minority of things like this but need to be aware
(eg GoogleDocs). Free software and Education &lt;br /&gt;
Schools must only teach free software. It's cheaper (but should be
considered secondary benefit). Free stuff from proprietary vendors is
simply a drug to get them hooked. Only free sw gives ppl the opportunity
to learn from code of large Programs. Even deeper reason though. For
goodwill and the moral imperative of sharing knowledge. Every school
from nursery to university must practice this. The issue should always
be an ethical one. Biggest obstacle to free sw is social inertia.

                <title>Session 4: Using audience insight to drive product success (BBC Case Study) #pcampldn</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Nic Newman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story of how they got it wrong and then put it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History: 2yrs ago, Weather site was pretty dated and had grand ambitions to update site.
 - Editorially led site
 - No product manager
 - No audience research plan
 - Drew wrong conclusions from research they did do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[video]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product took over a year to get out. BBC recorded thousands of complaints. Within 2-3 months it was re-launched, solving most of the problems. Site retested in beta with people who complained the last time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In original version did lots of focus groups and used this to decide what to do. eg ppl said they wanted everything on one page, so they did (without checking that it was right). Second thing was beta test was on folks that were weather nuts so they wanted all the detail. Public wanted simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For version 2, checked people's complaints and coded them so that there was a top ten list of things people didn't like. Then went back out to focus groups. Found people who were really angry and tried to work with these people to improve. Pressure from above (director general et al) meant quick wins were important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta test 2, tested on 1300 people and survey on their views in comparison with old weather site. Some quantitative data made a big difference when talking to DG about whether new site is going to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key learnings:
 - Have audience insight plan a
 - Qualitative followed by quantitative test is key
 - Make it iterative ... Audience research, usability and dev going concurrently
 - Regular testing to ensure that NetPromoter detractors and promoters both accept changes
 - Audience insights to inform communication plans of changes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kind of quantitative measures? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys and click-tracking. Eg of 1300 people, how many get to the forecast page and how many personalize the homepage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it important to build the tracking into the homepage? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, important not only in final site but also in the beta sites etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there danger that some of the ppl who complain the loudest are not representative? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absolutely. Danger is that others in company look at emails, comments, blogs and assume it's representative. Good to have data to show that they're not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

                <title>Session 3: What's your Product Mgmnt Persona? #pcampldn</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;[Missed session 2 due to Apple Mail + Wireless fail.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian Lunn from Product Focus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only handful of ppl put hand up to Q of &quot;who thinks they're a good PM&quot; :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product Focus do survey on ProdMgmnt.
 - Ave PM has been a PM for 8.5yrs (up from 7.5yrs last yr)
 - 44% of time spent on firefighting and 56% on planned activities &quot;too much time on tactical&quot;
 - lack of clarity on role/responsibility
 - 51% of projects delivered on time (some ppl in room think that's
high)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective ProdMgmnt. Now we have a 2x2 matrix [notepad ain't gonna help me w that]. Axes are knowledge/skills and actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 Personas
 - Numbers Guy
 - Subject Matter Expert
 - Expert Compromiser
 - Troubleshooter: Wild West Style
 - Product Champion/Advocate
 - Voice of Market
 - Reliable Project Manager
 - Multi-CEO (bit of everything)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biggest issue in ProdMgmnt in companies seems to be:
 - Lack of clarity on roles
 - lack of time for strategy
 - Ave salary is £61k base (cue murmurs from room...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job titles can be misleading. Can split work by activities.
 - Strategic PM Activities: Working out the right product
 - Inbound Activities: Helping business deliver the product
 - Outbound Activities: Helping business to sell the product&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has the role of PM changed over the years as it becomes more
recognised? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still a way to go. Better recognised but need more exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

                <title>Session 1: Data Driven Decisions #pcampldn</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Talk by Lucy from LoveFilm (@lucyjspence) Slides at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://slidesha.re/hFq1OB&quot;&gt;http://slidesha.re/hFq1OB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measure change through Experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About half the room has done some form of A/B testing before. Different changes, pages etc etc. Next thing to try is multivariate testing (MVT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radical A/B testing. Taken to an extreme you can have different journeys (separate website, even?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistical significance. Important to take note of since you need a certain volume of traffic before you can declare something as valid or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relation to product lifecycle. Lifecycle affects the kinds of tests you can do. Early on, can only do simple tests since you don't have volume to do valid MVT. As volume grows, then You can do more stuff and segment people. Eg separate ppl who come in via email campaign from other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advice:
- Respond to results
- Design for experimentation
- Design to segment/identify people by preference behaviour.
- Get the right tools for your org.
- Get ppl involved and pulling same direction
- Be prepared for things to go in the wrong direction from time to time. Don't get dispirited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q&amp;amp;A:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q Getting the right tools. Any recommendations? &lt;br /&gt;
A Google is a good start. website optimizer. Can let marketing ppl see what's going on. It's a monthly thing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A/B testing is great for testing ideas you've already got but doesn't help come up with new ideas. Does MVT etc help org come up with new ideas? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In some situations saying you can test things helps reduce risk. Depends on risk appetite of ppl too. It's just a tool so it just helps provide more info on what's happening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

                <title>Moved desks and discovered spent munitions as well as a weapons stockpile</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/singles/weapons-stockpile.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Weapons stockpile&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just moved desks from one side of the room to the other. While messing
with the cabling I also cleared out a bunch of nerf bullets from under
the desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if that's not ominous enough, behind me is what appears to be the
weapons stockpile (see pic above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to think that the New Year will bring peace, love and harmony
to this part of the building but that would be crazy talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be Switzerland (or maybe the Red Cross).&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Random things I learned at school</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the useful but slightly odd things that stuck with me from school came from one of the teachers I really didn't like. I never thought that particular class would have any relevance to the Rest Of My Life but here I am thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That one thing was a phrase that the teacher kept repeating, week after week. Anyone from my school will know exactly who I'm talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Make a statement, back it up with a quotation, then explain fully.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so the 'explain fully' part wasn't entirely explained (the irony), but I've found the general principle to be helpful when I'm trying to get my thoughts on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make your point. Provide some evidence. Explain it clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is on @nick_wood's desk. Yes, that's real hair. Yes, it's Nick's hair. So far you can see that it works on iPads and cakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure how much my therapy* will cost but it's going on expenses :-P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;*that's therapy &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; a dustbuster&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Update: Turns out that it doesn't work as well on cakes as I previously thought. I'd take another photo, but the cake is gone...&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Collective Intelligence in Human Groups</title>
                <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Evidence for a Collective Intelligence Factor in the Performance of Human Groups&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anita Williams Woolley,&lt;sup&gt;1,*&lt;/sup&gt; Christopher F. Chabris,&lt;sup&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt;
Alexander Pentland,&lt;sup&gt;3,4&lt;/sup&gt; Nada Hashmi,&lt;sup&gt;3,5&lt;/sup&gt; Thomas W.
Malone&lt;sup&gt;3,5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have repeatedly shown that a single
statistical factor—often called &quot;general intelligence&quot;—emerges from
the correlations among people's performance on a wide variety of
cognitive tasks. But no one has systematically examined whether a
similar kind of &quot;collective intelligence&quot; exists for groups of
people. In two studies with 699 individuals, working in groups of two
to five, we find converging evidence of a general
collective intelligence factor that explains a group's performance on
a wide variety of tasks. This &quot;&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; factor&quot; is not strongly
correlated with the average or maximum individual intelligence of
group members but is correlated with the average social
sensitivity of group members, the equality in distribution of
conversational turn-taking, and the proportion of females in the
group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds like great work and it's one of the things I wanted to study just before I started my PhD. Interesting to see that performance correlates with social sensitivity as well as the proportion of females in the group. I'd be very interested to know exactly what &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of tasks the teams were asked to perform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll have to wait till I'm next on campus before I can download the paper itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great time lapse movie. This volcano nearly scuppered my travel plans earlier this year but somehow I completely missed this footage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was at a good friend's PhD viva a couple of weeks ago and I was impressed with the 'pomp and circumstance' surrounding it.  Basically, the Dutch do PhD vivas/ceremonies way better than the Brits, especially given how much blood, sweat and tears are involved in getting to that stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were lots of photos that day but I've managed to capture most of the story in the selection of pictures above. There are lots of differences between what I saw and the UK system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, it's obvious that the event is a public affair although seating is strictly limited so it's usually just friends and relatives of the graduand (he's the tall guy in the middle of the first pic).  There is a committee of examiners who can question the candidate, which includes his supervisor and the period of questioning lasts no more than 45 minutes.  That's it.  At the end of the 45th minute, the master of ceremonies (can't remember his official title) will stop whoever's speaking and usher the committee out to deliberate.  By contrast, in the UK, the event would be a private meeting with only two examiners (supervisor not present), lasting anywhere between 1.5 to 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, the comparison isn't really fair.  In the Dutch system, the viva is much more of a ceremony than an examination.  The Thesis will already have been read and approved long before the public defence takes place.  That's including any corrections that have been requested.  Therefore, barring allegations of plagiarism, the outcome of the viva is already known to everyone which lends a much more ceremonial air to the proceedings.  That doesn't make the questions any less tricky though.  Once the committee returns from it's recess, there are some proclamations and the degree itself is awarded (it's in the blue tube).  After that, there's a drinks reception and few family/friends head off for dinner.  Overall, a very civilised affair with the attention squarely on the graduate throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I thought the Dutch method of graduating was way better than the UK equivalent (the expense notwithstanding).  After spending several years working on research followed by the effort of writing it up, I've always felt the UK ceremony was a bit of a let down.  Over here, families sit in a large room full of strangers, and watch a procession of other strangers spend 30-45 seconds in front of a robed figure before picking up a sheet of paper on their way out of the back door.  There's a brief flurry of excitement as you see your (insert_relation_here) have their few seconds of attention followed by the realisation that you still have to sit through the remainder of the class before you can leave.  Not much of a celebration of the achievement in my opinion (not that I should disparage it too much since I have yet to finish myself!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the fundamental differences in how PhDs are examined between the UK and the Netherlands, I'm not sure what we could do to introduce more of an 'individual ceremony', though it would certainly be nice to try.  If I ever get there, I'm making sure I mark the occasion properly ... which reminds me, back to work. :)&lt;/p&gt;

You can have your Ph D superviser in the room at UK universities. I opted not to, but in retrospect wish I had had him there. Just back form the Netherlands and watcehd a Ph D defense. Fascinating!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>This time-lapse montage will blow your mind</title>
                <description>

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-video widescreen vimeo&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/14352658?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;304&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen=&quot;true&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; allowFullScreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Time lapse montage&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What? Were you trying to use your brain for something right this
moment? Please stop that. Stop your multitasking, your conference
calling, and your SMS messaging for 2 minutes and 24 seconds, just
long enough to enjoy this fantastic time-lapse montage from Mike
Flores. It’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video was shot with a Canon 5D MKII and various lenses, including
the Canon 16-35mm f2.8 II, Canon 14mm f2.8 II, and Canon 24mm f1.4 II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's the audio that makes this work so well. The scenes with people in
aren't that spectacular so they're a little distracting, when compared
to the epic nature scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

you,&quot; I just wanna poke her in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girl: OW! You poked my eye!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boy: No, I poked you &lt;strong&gt;IN&lt;/strong&gt; the eye. And according to you, there's a
&lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt; difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Woah! Drinking tea prevents testicle shrinkage. Are you getting enough?</title>

&lt;p&gt;Wow. Random fact of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the recommended daily amount of Manganese is around few milligrams per day (some sites say up to a max of 11mg per day). The average cup of black tea has 0.2-0.8 mg of Manganese. Other sources of the mineral include soy, rice and beans and coffee (though I couldn't find how much there was in coffee)&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>I guess I'm going to have to play Starcraft 2</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/web/starcraft2-face.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Starcraft 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a slightly bizarre experience at lunch today. Pretty much everyone I sat with was talking about games they’d played in Starcraft II (see below). Words like &lt;em&gt;fast expand&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cruisers&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Zerg&lt;/em&gt; were being bandied about and for several minutes it felt like a different language (the terminology gets even more odd with things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=cheese+tactic&quot;&gt;cheese tactics&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, I speak English so I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; all the words but the order they were strung together in was alien to me. Direct peer pressure rarely works on me (and they’ve already tried) but apparently being part of a conversation where I’m failing to understand anything is like crack. I have to go off, google stuff and try and get a basic understanding. In this case, if I want to continue having lunch with these guys I’ll probably have to start playing. Given my tendency for getting addicted to (good) computer games, this could end badly for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, (this time) the conversation did move on to other topics, including male nurses and how PAs could take over the world. Epic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not surprisingly, the phone is designed for a world in which &quot;sharing
is the social norm.&quot; Not only will you be able to scroll through your
friends list and call people by tapping a button, Facebook will also
record who you called, what you said, and what you were wearing at the
time. This information will only be shared with law enforcement
agencies and carefully selected advertisers&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit to add:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Cambridge was voted best for research quality in a survey of 15,000 academics. It has an outstanding pedigree: famous minds who pushed back the frontiers of knowledge there include Newton, Darwin and Wittgenstein. Cambridge took overall first place in the rankings, which also use citation counts from a database of academic publishing&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantastic idea! I used to try doing this with recipes to make cooking easier but it always felt like too much effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there was a way to add your own recipes and have them presented back in this format, that would be really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;He got the name @paulg and @avibryant sorted it out for him. Seems like
the update hasn't filtered everywhere yet since I found the following at

                <title>Easily Aggregate Outlook, Google &amp; iCal calendar feeds</title>
                <description>&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t want to read the rest, here’s what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit the free service &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mashical.com&quot;&gt;MashiCal&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; create
a calendar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add each of your iCal feeds to your MashiCal calendar (adjust
settings as appropriate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the subscribe link (right-click and ‘copy link’ on the
aggregated calendar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You now have a link to an aggregated iCal feed of your calendar!\
 Below is the rest of the post for those with more patience ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/singles/Cal-Logos.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cal Logos&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why would anyone need to do this?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have multiple calendars, sharing free/busy information becomes
painful. One result is that too much time can be spent scheduling
meetings.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could combine all the calendar feeds into one free/busy feed then
I’d only have to share that one calendar with colleagues. So far none of
the applications I use are able to do this intelligently, and that’s
without the additional complexity of having multiple calendars in each
application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter MashiCal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Using MashiCal to merge .ics feeds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was already using BusyCal from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.busymac.com&quot;&gt;BusyMac&lt;/a&gt; so my
Apple iCal calendars sync with Google quite nicely. Therefore, I only
need to worry about getting my Google and Outlook calendars into one
feed. (NB It’s possible to publish a feed directly from Apple iCal so
you don’t need to buy any software)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Getting a feed from Google&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get your ics feed from your google calendar, visit the calendar’s
settings page. Make sure the calendar is shared otherwise the feed will
not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Getting a feed from Outlook&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Outlook 2007 you’ll need to right-click on the calendar you want to
create a feed for and “Publish to Internet”. When you’re prompted to
share the feed you just created you’ll be able to see the URL you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Aggregating the feeds&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have the iCal feeds you want to aggregate, visit MashiCal
and put them together. The interface is quite simple and MashiCal will
produce an Agenda view and provide a link at the top of the calendar
that you can share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware of the calendar settings for each feed you are entering since
timezones and refresh schedules may be relevant. Once it’s done you’ll
have a aggregated iCal feed that you can share with others. You can see
what my free/busy feed looks like
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mashical.com/cal?id=34df5231-84c6-475b-981e-6370459a84fb&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I’ve also collated my calendars into a general
&lt;a href=&quot;http://amirchaudhry.com/pages/freebusy&quot;&gt;free/busy&lt;/a&gt; page too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this was useful. I wrote this since it took me a while to
discover MashiCal and thought it might be useful for others too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*I’m aware there are services that try and solve this problem (e.g
&lt;a href=&quot;http://MeetWith.me&quot;&gt;MeetWithMe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tungle.me&quot;&gt;Tungle.Me&lt;/a&gt;
come to mind). However, I’m more interested in having an aggregated
free/busy feed which people can subscribe to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

This is cool. The scenario that really needs to be solved is... 2 working parents needing to view each others work schedules as well as personal appointments, maybe personal hotmail or gmail calendars at home and each has an outlook calendar on different work domains. And maybe throw in a teenager's schedule into the mix. Some details you want all to see and some you want to keep private but busy. Now take these calendars and figure out how to view them on each parent's phone. I've been playing with outlook connector which is great when you're at a pc, but the phone experience is missing and you really need that when you're on the road. Has anyone figured out the aggregate when multiple people are involved, and how to do it cleanly on phones?&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>My first 3-way</title>
                <description>&lt;h3&gt;BCPA Monthly Draw – June&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m the guy in the white helmet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-video&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3e4t-BA20Jo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;lipsum&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The above was my first attempt at a proper 3-way skydive. If you look closely it becomes obvious that I’m being dragged around. I’ve clearly got some work to do before I can keep up with these guys by myself. We did get 7 or 8 points though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;About the video&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ukskydiver.co.uk/cms/index.php?/topic/9412-bcpa-about-contact-how-to-join/&quot;&gt;BCPA&lt;/a&gt; is the national student body that promotes skydiving. Every month there’s a draw of three formations. The idea is to complete the sequence of formations (and repeat) as many times as possible within the time allowed (35sec).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June was the last draw of this academic year and the formations in the video are Sputnik, Opal and Cluster. The divepool these formations came from can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://img638.imageshack.us/img638/5070/bcpafs3waydivepool.gif&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Learning Markdown</title>
                <description>&lt;h3&gt;My first attempt at markdown&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having come across &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt; some time ago, I’ve decided to give it a try. This post is basically my attempt at using as many of the tags as possible. At least those I’m likely to
need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Reasons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More control over how how posts &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be able to &lt;strong&gt;emphasise&lt;/strong&gt; things in plain text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because I prefer using plain text email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As Gruber says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markdown’s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format
for writing for the web&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping I can get used to it. The last thing I need is to give myself
another roadblock to writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;edit: I didn’t get the list stuff correct the first time around&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>This is my posterous</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I've finally set up a blog after procrastinating for several months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still not sure what I'll be doing with it but since it seems to run via
email I expect I'll actually use it a lot more than other services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next post will be a link to my 3-way skydive video. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Edit: This used to be Posterous, until I moved to Jekyll and GitHub Pages in April 2012&lt;/p&gt;
