        <!-- <br /> -->
        <p>I've just updated my site's HTML/CSS and moved from Twitter Bootstrap to
<a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/features.html">Zurb Foundation</a>.  This post captures my subjective notes on the
migration.</p>

<h4>My use of Bootstrap</h4>

<p>When I originally set this site up, I didn't know what frameworks existed or
anything more than the basics of dealing with HTML (and barely any CSS).  I
came across Twitter Bootstrap and immediately decided it would Solve All My
Problems.  It really did.  Since then, I've gone through one 'upgrade' with
Bootstrap (from 1.x to 2.x), after which I dutifully ignored all the fixes
and improvements (note that Bootstrap was up to v2.3.2 while I was still
using v2.0.2).</p>

<p><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/switch-to-foundation/responsive-design.png" alt="Responsive Design" /></p>

<p>For the most part, this was fine with me but for a while now, I've been
meaning to make this site 'responsive' (read: not look like crap from a
mobile).  Bootstrap v3 purports to be mobile-first so upgrading would likely
give me what I'm after but v3 is <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/">not backwards compatible</a>,
meaning I'd have to rewrite parts of the HTML.  Since this step was
unavoidable, it led me to have another look at front-end frameworks, just to
see if I was missing anything.  This was especially relevant since we'd
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/announcing-new-ocamlorg/">just released</a> the new <a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml.org</a>
website, itself built with Bootstrap v2.3.1 (we'd done the design/templating
work long before v3 was released).  It would be useful to know what else is
out there for any future work.</p>

<p>Around this time I discovered Zurb Foundation and also the numerous
comparisons between them (note: Foundation seems to come out ahead in most
of those).  A few days ago, the folks at Zurb released
<a href="http://zurb.com/article/1280/foundation-5-blasts-off--2">version 5</a>, so I decided that now is the time to kick the
tires.  For the last few days, I've been playing with the framework and in
the end I decided to migrate my site over completely.</p>

<p><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/features.html"><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/switch-to-foundation/zurb-yeti.png" alt="Foundation's Yeti" /></a></p>

<h4>Swapping out one framework for another</h4>

<p>Over time, I've become moderately experienced with HTML/CSS and I can
usually wrangle things to look the way I want, but my solutions aren't
necessarily elegant. I was initially concerned that I'd already munged
things so much that changing anything would be a pain.  When I first put the
styles for this site together, I had to spend quite a bit of time
overwriting Bootstrap's defaults so I was prepared for the same when using
Foundation.  Turns out that I was fine.  I currently use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> (and
<a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com">Jekyll Bootstrap</a>) so I only had three template files and a couple of
HTML pages to edit and because I'd kept most of my custom CSS in a separate
file, it was literally a case of swapping out one framework for another and
bug-fixing from there onwards.  There's definitely a lesson here in using
automation as much as possible.</p>

<p>Customising the styles was another area of concern but I was pleasantly
surprised to find I needed <em>less</em> customisation than with Bootstrap.  This
is likely because I didn't have to override as many defaults (and probably
because I've learned more about CSS since then).  The one thing I seemed to
be missing was a way to deal with code sections, so I just took what
Bootstrap had and copied it in.  At some point I should revisit this.</p>

<p>It did take me a while to get my head around Foundation's grid but it was
worth it in the end.  The idea is that you should design for small screens
first and then adjust things for larger screens as necessary. There are
several different default sizes which inherit their properties from the size
below, unless you explicitly override them.  I initially screwed this up by
explicitly defining the grid using the <code>small-#</code> classes, which obviously
looks ridiculous on small screens.  I fixed it by swapping out <code>small-#</code> for
<code>medium-#</code> everywhere in the HTML, after which everything looked reasonable.
Items flowed sensibly into a default column for the small screens and looked
acceptable for larger screens and perfectly fine on desktops.  I could do
more styling of the mobile view but I'd already achieved most of what I was
after.</p>

<h4>Fixing image galleries and embedded content</h4>

<p>The only additional thing I used from Bootstrap was the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel">Carousel</a>. I'd
written some custom helper scripts that would take some images and
thumbnails from a specified folder and produce clickable thumbnails with a
slider underneath.  Foundation provides <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/orbit.html">Orbit</a>, so I had to spend time
rewriting my script to produce the necessary HTML.  This actually resulted
in cleaner HTML and one of the features I wanted (the ability to link to a
specific image) was available by default in Orbit.  At this point I also
tried to make the output look better for the case where JavaScript is
disabled (in essence, each image is just displayed as a list).  Below is an
example of an image gallery, taken from a previous post, when I
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/joined-the-computer-lab/">joined the computer lab</a>.</p>

<div class="gallery">
  <noscript><small><em>Note: The gallery needs JavaScript but I've tried to make it degrade gracefully. -Amir</em></small></noscript>
  <ul class="inline-list">
    
      <li><a data-orbit-link="join-comp-lab-1"><img src="/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-thumb-1.png" alt="join-comp-lab-thumb-1" /></a></li>
    
      <li><a data-orbit-link="join-comp-lab-2"><img src="/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-thumb-2.png" alt="join-comp-lab-thumb-2" /></a></li>
    
      <li><a data-orbit-link="join-comp-lab-3"><img src="/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-thumb-3.png" alt="join-comp-lab-thumb-3" /></a></li>
    
  </ul>
  <ul data-orbit data-options="next_on_click:true; timer_speed:3000; pause_on_hover:false; bullets:false;">
    
    <li class="gallery-image" data-orbit-slide="join-comp-lab-1"><img src="/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-1.jpg" alt="join-comp-lab-1"></li>
    
    <li class="gallery-image" data-orbit-slide="join-comp-lab-2"><img src="/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-2.jpg" alt="join-comp-lab-2"></li>
    
    <li class="gallery-image" data-orbit-slide="join-comp-lab-3"><img src="/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-3.jpg" alt="join-comp-lab-3"></li>
    
  </ul>
</div>


<p>Foundation also provides a component called <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/flex_video.html">Flex Video</a>, which allows the
browser to scale videos to the appropriate size.  This fix was as simple as
going back through old posts and wrapping anything that was <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> in a
<code>&lt;div class="flex-video"&gt;</code>.  It really was that simple and all the Vimeo and
YouTube items scaled perfectly.  Here's an example of a video from an
earlier post, where I gave a <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/">walkthrough of the ocaml.org site</a>.
Try changing the width of your browser window to see it scale.</p>

<div class="flex-video widescreen vimeo">
  <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/61768157?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=de9e6a" width="540" height="303" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowFullScreen="true">Video demo</iframe>
</div>


<h4>Framework differences</h4>

<p>Another of the main difference between the two frameworks is that Bootstrap
uses <a href="http://lesscss.org">LESS</a> to manage its CSS whereas Foundation uses <a href="http://sass-lang.com">SASS</a>.  Frankly,
I've no experience with either of them so it makes little difference to me.
It's worth bearing in mind for anyone who's workflow does involve
pre-processing.  Also, Bootstrap is available under the
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#license-faqs">Apache 2 License</a>, while Foundation is released under
the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/faq.html#question-3">MIT license</a>.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Overall, the transition was pretty painless and most of the time was spent
getting familiar with the grid, hunting for docs/examples and trying to make
the image gallery work the way I wanted.  I do think Bootstrap's docs are
better but Foundation's aren't bad.</p>

<p>Although this isn't meant to be a comparison, I much prefer Foundation to
Bootstrap.  If you're not sure which to use then I think the secret is in
the names of the frameworks.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bootstrap (for me) was a <em>great</em> way to '<em>bootstrap</em>' a site quickly with
lots of acceptable defaults -- it was quick to get started but took some
work to alter.</li>
<li>Foundation seems to provide a great '<em>foundation</em>' on which to create more
customised sites -- it's more flexible but needs more upfront thought.</li>
</ul>


<p>That's pretty much how I'd recommend them to people now.</p>
