        <h2><a class="post-title" href="/bitcoin-pinata">The Bitcoin Piñata!</a></h2>
        
<p>Last summer we announced the beta release of a clean-slate implementation of
TLS in pure OCaml, alongside a <a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/introducing-ocaml-tls">series of blog posts</a> that described
the libraries and the thinking behind them.  It took two hackers six months
— starting on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/GpcQs">the beach</a> —  to get the stack to that point and
their <a href="https://tls.openmirage.org">demo server</a> is still going strong. Since then, the team has
continued working and recently <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6443_-_en_-_saal_2_-_201412271245_-_trustworthy_secure_modular_operating_system_engineering_-_hannes_-_david_kaloper.html#video">presented</a> at the 31st Chaos
Communication Congress.</p>

<p>The latest example goes quite a bit further than a server that just displays
the handshake. This time, the team have constructed a Xen unikernel that’s
holding a private key to a bitcoin address and are asking people to try and
<em>break in</em>. Hence, they’ve called it the <strong><a href="http://ownme.ipredator.se">Bitcoin Piñata</a></strong>!*</p>

<h2 id="what-the-bitcoin-piata-does">What the Bitcoin Piñata does</h2>

<p><a href="http://ownme.ipredator.se"><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/btc-pinata/btc-pinata.png" alt="Bitcoin Pinata" /></a></p>

<p>The Piñata unikernel will transmit its private bitcoin key if you can
successfully set up a TLS connection <strong>but</strong> it’s rigged so that it will <em>only</em>
create that connection if you can present the certificate it’s expecting to
see — which has been <em>signed appropriately</em>.  Of course, you’re not being given
the secret key with which to do that signing and that means there should be
<em>no way</em> for anyone to form a TLS connection with the Piñata.
In order to get the private key to the bitcoin address, you’ll have to smash
your way in.</p>

<p>Helpfully (perhaps), things are set up so that you <em>can</em> make the Piñata talk
to itself, allowing you to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">eavesdrop</a> on a successful connection and
see the encrypted traffic. In addition, all the <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/btc-pinata">code and libraries</a> are
open-source so you can look through any of the codebase.  There isn’t anything
that anyone will have to reverse engineer, which should make this a little
more enjoyable.</p>

<p>This contest is set to run until mid-March or whenever the coins are taken.
If someone does manage to get in, please do let us know how!</p>

<h3 id="the-rubber-hose-approach">The Rubber-hose approach</h3>

<p>Of course there are many other ways to get at the private key and as many
people like to comment, the human element is sometimes the weakest link — 
after all, a safe is only as secure as the person with the combination.</p>

<p>In this case, there is obviously a secret key or certificate <em>somewhere</em>
that could be presented so it may be tempting to go hunting for that. Perhaps
phishing attempts on the authors may yield a way forward, or maybe just
straight-forward <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis">Rubber-hose cryptanalysis</a>!  Sure, these
options might provide a result<sup>†</sup> but this is meant to be fun.
The authors haven’t specified any rules but please be nice and focus on the
technical things around the Piñata. Don’t be this guy.</p>

<p><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/btc-pinata/pinata-kid-bat.gif" alt="Pinata-kid-bat" /></p>

<h2 id="whats-the-point-of-this-contest">What’s the point of this contest?</h2>

<p>Even though the Bitcoin Piñata is clearly a contest, nobody is deluding
themselves into thinking that if the coins are still there in March, that
somehow the stack can be declared ‘undefeated’ — while pleasing, that
result wouldn’t necessarily <em>prove</em> anything. Contests have their place but as
Bruce Schneier <a href="https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/1998/1215.html#contests">already pointed out</a>, they are not useful mechanisms
to judge security.</p>

<p>However, it does give us the chance to engage in some shameless self-promotion
and try to draw vast amounts of attention to the work. That, and the chance to
stress-test the stack in the wild. Ultimately, we <em>want</em> to use this code in
production but must take a lot of care to get there and want to be sure that
it can bear up. This is just one more way of learning what happens when
putting something ‘real’ out there. </p>

<p>If the Bitcoins <em>do</em> end up being taken, then there’s <em>definitely</em> something
valuable that the team can learn from that. Regardless of the Piñata, if we
have more people exploring the <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/">TLS codebase</a> or trying it out for
themselves, it will undoubtedly be A Good Thing. </p>

<h5 id="responsible-sidenote">Responsible sidenote</h5>

<p><em>For clarity and to avoid any doubt, please be aware that the TLS codebase is
missing external code audits and is not yet intended for use in any security
critical applications.  All development is done in the open, including the
tracking of <a href="https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-tls/issues?q=label%3A%22security+concern%22+">security-related issues</a>, so please do consider
auditing the code, testing it in your services and reporting issues.</em></p>

<p class="footnote">* If you've never come across a piñata before, hopefully 
    the gif in the post gives you an idea.  If not, the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinata">wiki page</a>
    will surely help, where I learned that the origin may be Chinese rather
    than Spanish!
</p>

<p class="footnote"><sup>&dagger;</sup> Of course, I'm not suggesting that
    anyone would actually go this far. I'm simply acknowledging that there is
    a human factor and asking that we put it aside.

        <h2><a class="post-title" href="/unikernel-arm-demo-fosdem">Unikernel demo at FOSDEM</a></h2>
        
<p>Last weekend was spent at one of the world’s biggest open source conferences,
FOSDEM.  You can check out <a href="http://nymote.org/blog/2014/fosdem-summary/">last year’s review</a> to get an idea of
the scale of the event. Since there’s no registration process, it’s difficult
to estimate how many people attend but given how many rooms there are, and how
full they are, it’s easily several thousand. I was impressed last year at how
smoothly things went and the same was true this year.</p>

<p>The main reason to attend this time was to run a demo of MirageOS from an ARM
board — one of the main advances since the previous conference. I looked over
all the things we’d achieved since last year and put together a demo that
showcases some of the capabilities as well as being fun.</p>

<h3 id="from-a-unikernel-on-an-arm-board">2048 from a Unikernel on an ARM board</h3>

<p>The demo was to serve the 2048 game from a Unikernel running on a Cubieboard2
with its own access point.  When people join the wifi network, they get
served a static page and can begin playing the game immediately.  </p>

<p>The components I needed for the demo were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Code for the 2048 game — I was able to lift code from a
<a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/2048-tutorial/">tutorial last year</a>, which <a href="http://erratique.ch">Daniel</a>, <a href="http://www.lpw25.net">Leo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/yallop">Jeremy</a> and
<a href="http://gazagnaire.org">Thomas</a> all contributed to. It was first run at <a href="http://cufp.org/2014/t7-leo-white-introduction-to-ocaml.html">CUFP 2014</a> then
adapted and presented at <a href="http://booking.agilefaqs.com/functional-conf-2014#workshop-52-info">Functional Conf</a> in India (see the
<a href="http://gazagnaire.org/fuconf14/">IOCaml notebook</a>).  Attendees wrote the code in OCaml, which was
then compiled into pure JavaScript (via <a href="http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/">js_of_ocaml</a>). The result can be run
completely in the browser and only involves serving two files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Code for making a static website — Since the game is completely
self-contained (one html file and one js file). I only need to convert a static
website into a unikernel.  That’s trivial and
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/unikernels-for-everyone/">many people have done it before</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Cubieboard with a wifi access point — There are pre-built images on the
<a href="http://blobs.openmirage.org">MirageOS website</a>, which make part of this easy. However, getting the
wifi access point up involves a few more steps.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The first two pieces should be straightforward and indeed, I had a working
unikernel serving the 2048 game within minutes (unix version on my laptop). 
The additional factors around the ARM deployment is where things were a little
more involved. Although this was technically straightforward to set up, it
still took a while to get all the pieces together.  A more detailed
description of the steps is in my <a href="https://github.com/amirmc/fosdemo">fosdemo repository</a> and in
essence, it revolves around configuring the wifi access point and setting up a
bridge (thanks to <a href="http://somerandomidiot.com">Mindy</a>, <a href="http://www.skjegstad.com">Magnus</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pqwy">David</a> for getting this
working).</p>

<p>Once this was all up and running, it was a simple matter to configure the
board to boot the unikernel on startup, so that no manual intervention would
be required to set things up at the booth.</p>

<h4 id="running-the-demo">Running the demo</h4>

<p>I gave the demo at the Xen booth and it went very well.  There was a small
crowd throughout my time at the booth I’m convinced that the draw of a board
with glowing LEDs should not be underestimated.  Many people we’re happy to
connect to the access point and download the game to their browser but there
were two main things I learnt.</p>

<p>Firstly, demos involving games will work if people actually <em>know</em> the game.
This is obvious, but I’d assumed that most people had already played 2048 —
especially the crowd I’d expect to meet at FOSDEM.  It turned out that around
a third of people had no idea what to do when the game loaded onto their
browser. They stared blankly at it and then blankly at me.  Of course, it was
trivial to get them started and they were soon absorbed by it — but it still
felt like some of the ‘cool-factor’ had been lost.</p>

<p>The second thing was that I tried to explain too much to people in much too
short a time.  This particular demo involved Xen unikernels, js_of_ocaml and a
Cubieboard2 with a wifi access point.
There’s a surprisingly large amount of technology there, which
is difficult explain to a complete newcomer within one or two minutes.  When
it was obvious someone hadn’t heard of unikernels, I focused on the approach
of library operating systems and the benefits that Mirage brings. If a visitor
was already familiar with the concept of unikernels, I could describe the rest
of the demo in more detail.</p>

<p>Everything else did go well and next time I’d like to have a demo like this
running with <a href="https://github.com/MagnusS/jitsu">Jitsu</a>.  That way, I could configure it so that a unikernel
would spin up, serve the static page and then spin down again. If we can
figure out the timing, then providing stats in the page about the lifetime of
that unikernel would also be great, but that’s for another time.</p>

<h5 id="sidenote-the-beginnings-of-a-personal-cloud">Sidenote: The beginnings of a ‘personal cloud’</h5>

<p>One of the things we’re keen to work towards is the idea of
<a href="http://nymote.org">personal clouds</a>. It’s not a stretch to imagine that a Cubieboard2,
running the appropriate software, could act as one particular node in a
network of your own devices. In this instance it’s just hosting a fun and
simple game but more complex applications are also possible.</p>

<h3 id="huge-range-of-sessions-and-talks">Huge range of sessions and talks</h3>

<p>Of course, there was lots more going on than just my demo and I had a great
time attending the talks. Some in particular that stood out to me were those
in the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/track/open_source_design/">open source design</a> room, which was a new addition this year. It
was great to learn that there are design people out there who would like to
contribute to open source (<a href="https://twitter.com/amirmc">get in touch</a>, if that’s you!). I also had a
chance to meet (and thank!) Mike McQuaid in his <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/homebrew_the_good,_bad_and_ugly_of_osx_packaging/">Homebrew talk</a>.
FOSDEM is one of those great events where you can meet in person all those
folks you’ve only interacted with online.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a great trip and I thoroughly recommend it if you’ve never
been before!</p>

        <h2><a class="post-title" href="/brewing-miso-to-serve-nymote">Brewing MISO to serve Nymote</a></h2>
        
<p>The <a href="http://nymote.org/blog/2013/introducing-nymote/">mission of Nymote</a> is to enable the creation of resilient
decentralised systems that incorporate privacy from the ground up, so that
users retain control of their networks and data.  To achieve this, we
reconsider all the old assumptions about how software is created in light of
the problems of the modern, networked environment.  Problems that will become
even more pronounced as more devices and sensors find their way into our lives.</p>

<p>We want to make it simple for anyone to be able to run a piece of the cloud
for their own purposes and the first three applications Nymote targets are
Mail, Contacts and Calendars, but to get there, we first have to create solid
foundations.</p>

<h3 id="defining-the-bedrock">Defining the bedrock</h3>

<p>In order to create applications that work for the user, we first have to
create a robust and reliable software stack that takes care of fundamental
problems for us. In other words, to be able to assemble the applications we
desire, we must first construct the correct building blocks.</p>

<p>We’ve taken a clean-slate approach so that we can build long-lasting solutions
with all the benefits of hindsight but none of the baggage. As
mentioned in earlier posts, there are three main components of the stack,
which are: <a href="http://nymote.org/software/mirage/">Mirage</a> (OS for the Cloud/IoT), <a href="http://nymote.org/software/irmin/">Irmin</a> (distributed datastore)
and <a href="http://nymote.org/software/signpost/">Signpost</a> (identity and connectivity) - all built using the <a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml</a>
programming language.</p>

<h4 id="using-the-miso-stack-to-build-nymote">Using the MISO stack to build Nymote</h4>

<p>As you’ve already noticed, there’s a useful acronym for the above tools —
<strong>MISO</strong>. Each of the projects mentioned is a serious undertaking in its own
right and each is likely to be impactful as a stand-alone concept.  However,
when used together we have the opportunity to create applications and services
with high levels of security, scalability and stability, which are not easy to
achieve using other means. </p>

<p>In other words, MISO is the <em>toolstack</em> that we’re using to build Nymote —
Nymote is the <em>decentralised system</em> that works for its users.</p>

<p>Each of the projects is at a different phase but they have all have made great
strides over the last year.</p>

<h4 id="mirage">Mirage</h4>

<p>Mirage — a library operating system that constructs unikernels — is the most
mature part of the stack. I previously wrote about the
<a href="http://nymote.org/blog/2014/announcing-first-mirage-release/">Mirage 1.0 release</a> and only six months later we had an
<a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/announcing-mirage-20-release">impressive 2.0 release</a>, with continuing advances throughout the year.
We achieved major milestones such as the ability to deploy unikernels to
ARM-based devices, as well as a clean-slate implementation of the transport
layer security (TLS) protocol.</p>

<p>In addition to the development efforts, there have also been many
presentations to audiences, ranging from <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/describing-miso-entrepreneur-first-2014/">small groups of startups</a>
all the way to <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6443_-_en_-_saal_2_-_201412271245_-_trustworthy_secure_modular_operating_system_engineering_-_hannes_-_david_kaloper.html#video">prestigious keynotes</a> with 1000+ attendees.  Ever
since we’ve had ARM support, the talks themselves have been delivered from
unikernels running on Cubieboards and you can see the growing collection of
slides at <a href="http://decks.openmirage.org">decks.openmirage.org</a>.</p>

<p>All of these activities have led to a tremendous increase in public awareness
of unikernels and the value they can bring to developing robust, modern
software as well as the promise of <a href="https://medium.com/@darrenrush/after-docker-unikernels-and-immutable-infrastructure-93d5a91c849e">immutable infrastructure</a>.
As more people look to get involved and contribute to the codebase, we’ve also
begun curating a set of <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Pioneer-Projects">Pioneer Projects</a>, which are suitable for a
range of skill-levels.</p>

<p>You can find much more information on all the activities of 2014 in the
comprehensive <a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/2014-in-review">Mirage review post</a>. As it’s the most mature
component of the MISO stack, anyone interested in the <em>development of code</em>
towards Nymote should join the <a href="http://lists.xenproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mirageos-devel">Mirage mailing list</a>.</p>

<h4 id="irmin">Irmin</h4>

<p>Irmin — a library to persist and synchronize distributed data structures —
made significant progress last year. It’s based on the principles of Git, the
distributed version control system, and allows developers to choose the
appropriate combination of consistency, availability and partition tolerance
for their needs.</p>

<p>Early last year Irmin was released as an alpha with the ability to speak
‘fluent Git’ and by the summer, it was supporting user-defined merge
operations and fast in-memory views.  A couple of summer projects improved the
<a href="http://gazagnaire.org/pub/FGM15.pdf">merge strategies</a> and synchronisation strategies, while an
external project — Xenstore — used Irmin to <a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/introducing-irmin-in-xenstore">add fault-tolerance</a>.</p>

<p>More recent work has involved a big clean-up in the user-facing API (with nice
<a href="http://samoht.github.io/irmin/">developer documentation</a>) and a cleaner high-level REST API.
Upcoming work includes proper documentation of the REST API, which means Irmin
can more easily be used in non-OCaml projects, and full integration with
Mirage projects. </p>

<p>Irmin is already being used to create
<a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/imaplet-lwt/imaplet-lwt.0.1.3/">a version controlled IMAP server</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/samoht/dog">a version controlled distributed log system</a>. It’s no surprise
that the first major release is coming <a href="https://github.com/mirage/irmin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.0.0">very soon</a>!</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="signpost">Signpost</h4>

<p>Signpost will be a collection of libraries that aims to provide identity and
connectivity between devices.  Forming efficient connections between
end-points is becoming ever more important as the number of devices we own
increases. These devices need to be able to recognise and reach each-other,
regardless of their location on the network or the obstacles in between. </p>

<p>This is very much a nascent project and it involves a lot of work on
underlying libraries to ensure that security aspects are properly considered.
As such, we must take great care in how we implement things and be clear about
any trade-offs we make. Our thoughts are beginning to converge on a design we
think will work and that we would entrust with our own data, but we’re
treating this as a case of ‘Here Be Dragons’.  This is a critical piece of the
stack and we’ll share what we learn as we chart our way towards it.</p>

<p>Even though we’re at the design stage of Signpost, we did substantial work
last year to create the libraries we might use for implementation.  A
particularly exciting one is <a href="https://github.com/MagnusS/jitsu">Jitsu</a> — which stands for Just In Time
Summoning of Unikernels. This is a DNS server that spawns unikernels in
response to DNS requests and boots them in real-time with no perceptible lag
to the end user.  In other words, it makes much more efficient use of
resources and significantly reduces latency of services for end-users —
services are only run <em>when</em> they need to be, in the <em>places</em> they need to be. </p>

<p>There’s also been lots of efforts on other libraries that will help us
<em>iterate towards</em> a complete solution. Initially, we will use pre-existing
implementations but in time we can take what we’ve learned and create more
robust alternatives. Some of the libraries are listed below (but note the
friendly disclaimers!). </p>

<h4 id="ocaml">OCaml</h4>

<p><a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml</a> is a mature, powerful and highly pragmatic language.  It’s
proven ideal for creating robust systems applications and
<a href="http://ocaml.org/learn/companies.html">many others</a> also recognise this.  We’re using it to create all the
tools you’ve read about so far and we’re also helping to improve the ecosystem
around it.</p>

<p>One of the major things we’ve been involved with is the coordination of the
OCaml Platform, which combines the OCaml compiler with a coherent set of tools
and workflows to be more productive in the language and speed up development
time.  We presented the first major release of these efforts at OCaml 2014 and
you can <a href="http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2014/ocaml2014_7.pdf">read the abstract</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxhtpQ5nJHg&amp;list=UUP9g4dLR7xt6KzCYntNqYcw">watch the video</a>.</p>

<p>There’s more to come, as we continue to improve the tooling and also support
the community in <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/towards-governance-framework-for-ocamlorg">other ways</a>.</p>

<h3 id="early-steps-towards-applications">Early steps towards applications</h3>

<p>Building blocks are important but we also need to push towards working
applications.  There are different approaches we’ve taken to this, which
include building prototypes, wireframing use-cases and implementing features
with other toolstacks.  Some of this work is also part of a larger
<a href="http://usercentricnetworking.eu">EU funded project</a>* and below are brief summaries of the things we’ve
done so far. We’ll expand on them as we do more over time.</p>

<p><strong>Mail</strong> - As mentioned above, a prototype IMAP server exists (<a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/imaplet-lwt/imaplet-lwt.0.1.3/">IMAPlet</a>)
which uses Irmin to store data. This is already able to connect to a client to
serve mail. The important feature is that it’s an IMAP server which is version
controlled in the backend and can expose a REST API from the mailstore quite
easily.</p>

<p><strong>Contacts</strong> - We first made wireframe mockups of the features we might like
in a contacts app (to follow in later post) and then built a
<a href="https://github.com/yansh/contacts-app">draft implementation</a>. To get here, code was first written in OCaml
and then put through the <a href="http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/">js_of_ocaml</a> compiler. This is valuable as it
takes us closer to a point where we can build networks using our address books
and have the system take care of sharing details in a privacy-conscious manner
and with minimal maintenance. The <a href="http://yansnotes.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/work-summary-ocaml-labs.html">summary post</a> has more detail.</p>

<p><strong>Calendar</strong> - This use-case was approached in a completely different way as
part of a hackathon last year. A rough but functional prototype was built over
one weekend, with a team formed at the event.  It was centralised but it
tested the idea that a service which integrates intimately with your life (to
the point of being very invasive) can provide disproportionate benefits.  The
<a href="http://seedcamp.com/seedhack-5-0/">experience report</a> describes the weekend and our app — Clarity —
won first place. This was <em>great</em> validation that the features are desirable
so we need to work towards a decentralised, privacy-conscious version.</p>

<h3 id="time-to-get-involved">Time to get involved!</h3>

<p>The coming year represents the best time to be working on the MISO stack and
using it to make Nymote a reality.  All source code is publicly available and
the projects are varied enough that there is something for everyone.  Browse
through issues, consider the <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Pioneer-Projects">projects</a> or simply write online and
share with us the things you’d like to see.

        <h2><a class="post-title" href="/unikernels-for-everyone">Unikernels for everyone!</a></h2>
        
<p>Many people have now set up unikernels for blogs, documenting their
experiences for others to follow.  Even more important is that people are
going beyond static sites to build unikernels that provide more complicated
services and solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>To help newcomers get started, there are now even more posts that that use
different tools and target different deployment methods.  Below are summaries
of some of the posts I found interesting and that will make it easier for you
try out different ways of creating and deploying your unikernels.</p>

<h3 id="unikernel-blogs-with-mirageos">Unikernel blogs with MirageOS</h3>

<p>Mindy picked up where the <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/from-jekyll-to-unikernel-in-fifty-lines/">first set of instructions</a>
finished and described her work to get an Octopress blog running on Amazon EC2.
As one of the first people outside the core team to work on this, she had a
lot of interesting experiences — which included getting into the Mirage
networking stack to debug an issue and submit a bugfix!  More recently, she
also wrote a couple of excellent posts on <em>why</em> she uses a unikernel for her
blog.  These posts cover the security concerns (and responsibility) of running
networked services on today’s Internet and the importance of owning your
content — both ideas are at the heart of the work behind <a href="http://nymote.org/">Nymote</a> and are
well worth reading.</p>

<p>Ian took a different path to AWS deployment by using Vagrant and Test Kitchen
to to get his static site together and build his unikernel, and then Packer to
create the images for deployment to EC2.  All succinctly explained with code
available on GitHub for others to try out!</p>

</ul>

<p>Toby wanted to put together a blog that was a little more complicated than a
traditional static site, with specific features like subdomains based on tags
and the ability to set future dates for posts. He also pulled in some other
libraries so he can use Mustache for sever-side rendering, where his blog
posts and metadata are stored as JSON and rendered on request.</p>

<p>Chris saw others working to get unikernel blogs on EC2 and decide he’d try
getting his up and running on Linode instead.  He is the first person to
deploy his unikernel to Linode and he provided a great walkthough with helpful
screenshots, as well as brief notes about the handful of differences compared
with EC2.  Chris also wrote about the issue he had with clean urls (i.e
serving <code>/about/index.html</code> when a user visits <code>/about/</code>) — he describes the
things he tried out until he was finally able to fix it.  </p>

<p>Phil focused on getting unikernels running on a cubieboards, which are ARM
based development boards — similar to the Raspberry Pi. He starts by taking
Mirage’s pre-built <a href="http://blobs.openmirage.org">Cubieboard images</a> — which makes it easy to
get Xen and an OCaml environment set up on the board — and getting this
installed on the Cubieboard.  He also noted the issues he came across along
with the simple tweaks he made to fix them and finally serves a Mirage hello
world page.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="more-than-just-static-sites">More than just static sites</h3>

<p>Static sites have become the new ‘hello world’ app. They’re simple to manage,
low-risk and provide lots of opportunities to experience something new.  These
aspects make them ideal for discovering the benefits (and trade offs) of the
unikernel approach and I look forward to seeing what variations people come up
with — For instance, there aren’t any public instructions for deploying to
Rackspace so it would be great to read about someone’s experiences there.
However, there are also many other applications that also fit the above
criteria of simplicity, low risk and plentiful learning opportunities. </p>

<p>Thomas Leonard decided to create a unikernel for a simple REST service for
queuing package uploads for 0install.  His post takes you from the very
beginning, with a simple hello world program running on Xen, all the way
through to creating his REST service. Along the way there a lots of code
snippets and explanations of the libraries being used and what they’re doing.
This is a great use-case for unikernels and there are a lot of interesting
things to take from this post, for example the ease with which Thomas was able
to find and fix bugs using regular tools. There’s also lots of information on
performance testing and optimising of the unikernel, which he covers in a
follow-up post, and he even built tools to visualise the traces. </p>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there’s much more activity out there than described in this post as
people continually propose ideas on the <a href="http://lists.xenproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mirageos-devel">Mirage mailing list</a> — both
for things they would like to try out and issues they came up against. In my
<a href="http://nymote.org/blog/2014/from-jekyll-site-to-unikernel/">last post</a>, I pointed out that the workflow is applicable to any
type of unikernel and as Thomas showed, with bit of effort it’s already
possible to create useful, real-world services using the many libraries that
already exist. There’s also a lot of scaffolding in the <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton">mirage-skeleton</a>
repo that you can build on which makes it even easier to get involved.  If you
want to dive deeper into the libraries and perhaps learn OCaml, there are lots
of <a href="http://ocaml.org/learn/books.html">resources online</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Pioneer-Projects">projects</a> to get involved with too.</p>

<p>Now is a great time to try building a unikernel for yourself and as you can
see from the posts above, shared experiences help other people progress
further and branch out into new areas. When you’ve had a chance to try
something out please do share your experiences online! </p>

        <h2><a class="post-title" href="/towards-governance-framework-for-ocamlorg">Towards a governance framework for OCaml.org</a></h2>
        
<p>The projects around the OCaml.org domain name are becoming more established
and it’s time to think about how they’re organised. 2014 saw a <em>lot</em> of
activity, which built on the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/news/index.html#OnlineatOCamlorg">successes from 2013</a>.
Some of the main things that stand out to me are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>More <a href="http://ocaml.org/contributors.html">volunteers</a> contributing to the public website with
translations, bug fixes and content updates, as well as many new visitors —
for example, the new page on <a href="http://ocaml.org/learn/teaching-ocaml.html">teaching OCaml</a> received over 5k
visits alone. The increasing contributions are a result of the earlier work on
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/announcing-new-ocamlorg/">re-engineering the site</a> and there are many ways to get involved
so please do <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/labels/contribute%21">contribute</a>!</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/web/opampkg-2015-01-08.png" /></a></p>

<ul>
  <li>The relentless improvements and growth of OPAM, both in terms of the
repository — with over 1000 additional packages and several
<a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/opam-devel/2014-October/000781.html">new repo maintainers</a> — and also improved workflows (e.g the new
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-1-2-pin/">pin functionality</a>). 
The OPAM site and package list also moved to the ocaml.org domain, becoming
the substrate for the OCaml Platform efforts. This began with the work towards
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-1-2-0-beta4/">OPAM 1.2</a> and there is much more to come (including closer
integration in terms of styling). Join the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/platform">Platform list</a> to
keep up to date.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Much more activity on the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org">mailing lists</a> in general and user groups
requesting to have lists made (e.g the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/teaching">teaching list</a>). If anyone
has a need for a new list, just ask on the
<a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure">infrastructure list</a>!</li>
</ul>

<p>There is other work besides those I’ve mentioned and I think by any measure,
all the projects have been quite successful. As the community continues to
develop, it’s important to clarify how things currently work to improve the
level of transparency and make it easier for newcomers to get involved.</p>

<h3 id="factors-for-a-governance-framework">Factors for a governance framework</h3>

<p>For the last couple of months, I’ve been looking over how larger projects
manage themselves and the governance documents that are available. My aim has
been to put such a document together for the OCaml.org domain without
introducing burdensome processes.  There are number of things that stood out
to me during this process, which have guided the approach I’m taking.</p>

<p>My considerations for an OCaml.org governance document:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A governance document is not <em>necessary</em> for success but it’s valuable to
demonstrate a commitment to a <strong>stable decision-making process</strong>.  There are
many projects that progress perfectly well without any documented processes
and indeed the work around OCaml.org so far is a good example of this (as well
as OCaml itself).  However, for projects to achieve a scale greater than the
initial teams, it’s a significant benefit to encode in writing how things work
(NB: please note that I didn’t define the <em>type</em> of decision-making process -
merely that it’s a stable one).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must <strong>clarify its scope</strong> so that there is no confusion about what the
document covers. In the case of OCaml.org, it needs to be clear that the
governance covers the domain itself, rather than referring to the website. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should <strong>document the reality</strong>, rather than represent an aspirational
goal or what people <em>believe</em> a governance structure should look like.  It’s
very tempting to think of an idealised structure without recognising that
behaviours and norms have <em>already</em> been established. Sometimes this will be
vague and poorly defined but that might simply indicate areas that the
community hasn’t encountered yet (e.g it’s uncommon for any new project to
seriously think about dispute resolution processes until they have to).  In
this sense, the initial version of a governance document should simply be a
written description of how things currently stand, rather than a means to
adjust that behaviour.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be <strong>simple and self-contained</strong>, so that anyone can understand
the intent quickly without recourse to other documents.  It may be tempting to
consider every edge-case or try to resolve every likely ambiguity but this
just leads to large, legal documents.  This approach may well be necessary
once projects have reached a certain scale but to implement it sooner would be
a case of premature optimisation — not to mention that very few people would 
read and remember such a document.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s a <strong>living document</strong>. If the community decides that it would prefer a
new arrangement, then the document conveniently provides a stable starting
point from which to iterate. Indeed, it <em>should</em> adapt along with the project
that it governs. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With the above points in mind, I’ve been putting together a draft governance
framework to cover how the OCaml.org domain name is managed.  It’s been a
quiet work-in-progress for some time and I’ll be getting in touch with
maintainers of specific projects soon.  Once I’ve had a round of reviews, I’ll
be sharing it more widely and posting it here!</p>
