        <h2><a class="post-title" href="/towards-governance-framework-for-ocamlorg">Towards a governance framework for OCaml.org</a></h2>
        <p>The projects around the OCaml.org domain name are becoming more established
and it's time to think about how they're organised. 2014 saw a <em>lot</em> of
activity, which built on the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/news/index.html#OnlineatOCamlorg">successes from 2013</a>.
Some of the main things that stand out to me are:</p>

<ul>
<li>More <a href="http://ocaml.org/contributors.html">volunteers</a> contributing to the public website with
translations, bug fixes and content updates, as well as many new visitors —
for example, the new page on <a href="http://ocaml.org/learn/teaching-ocaml.html">teaching OCaml</a> received over 5k
visits alone. The increasing contributions are a result of the earlier work on
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/announcing-new-ocamlorg/">re-engineering the site</a> and there are many ways to get involved
so please do <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/labels/contribute%21">contribute</a>!</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/web/opampkg-2015-01-08.png"></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The relentless improvements and growth of OPAM, both in terms of the
repository — with over 1000 additional packages and several
<a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/opam-devel/2014-October/000781.html">new repo maintainers</a> — and also improved workflows (e.g the new
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-1-2-pin/">pin functionality</a>).
The OPAM site and package list also moved to the ocaml.org domain, becoming
the substrate for the OCaml Platform efforts. This began with the work towards
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-1-2-0-beta4/">OPAM 1.2</a> and there is much more to come (including closer
integration in terms of styling). Join the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/platform">Platform list</a> to
keep up to date.</p></li>
<li><p>Much more activity on the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org">mailing lists</a> in general and user groups
requesting to have lists made (e.g the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/teaching">teaching list</a>). If anyone
has a need for a new list, just ask on the
<a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure">infrastructure list</a>!</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There is other work besides those I've mentioned and I think by any measure,
all the projects have been quite successful. As the community continues to
develop, it's important to clarify how things currently work to improve the
level of transparency and make it easier for newcomers to get involved.</p>

<h3>Factors for a governance framework</h3>

<p>For the last couple of months, I've been looking over how larger projects
manage themselves and the governance documents that are available. My aim has
been to put such a document together for the OCaml.org domain without
introducing burdensome processes.  There are number of things that stood out
to me during this process, which have guided the approach I'm taking.</p>

<p>My considerations for an OCaml.org governance document:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A governance document is not <em>necessary</em> for success but it's valuable to
demonstrate a commitment to a <strong>stable decision-making process</strong>.  There are
many projects that progress perfectly well without any documented processes
and indeed the work around OCaml.org so far is a good example of this (as well
as OCaml itself).  However, for projects to achieve a scale greater than the
initial teams, it's a significant benefit to encode in writing how things work
(NB: please note that I didn't define the <em>type</em> of decision-making process -
merely that it's a stable one).</p></li>
<li><p>It must <strong>clarify its scope</strong> so that there is no confusion about what the
document covers. In the case of OCaml.org, it needs to be clear that the
governance covers the domain itself, rather than referring to the website.</p></li>
<li><p>It should <strong>document the reality</strong>, rather than represent an aspirational
goal or what people <em>believe</em> a governance structure should look like.  It's
very tempting to think of an idealised structure without recognising that
behaviours and norms have <em>already</em> been established. Sometimes this will be
vague and poorly defined but that might simply indicate areas that the
community hasn't encountered yet (e.g it's uncommon for any new project to
seriously think about dispute resolution processes until they have to).  In
this sense, the initial version of a governance document should simply be a
written description of how things currently stand, rather than a means to
adjust that behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>It should be <strong>simple and self-contained</strong>, so that anyone can understand
the intent quickly without recourse to other documents.  It may be tempting to
consider every edge-case or try to resolve every likely ambiguity but this
just leads to large, legal documents.  This approach may well be necessary
once projects have reached a certain scale but to implement it sooner would be
a case of premature optimisation — not to mention that very few people would
read and remember such a document.</p></li>
<li><p>It's a <strong>living document</strong>. If the community decides that it would prefer a
new arrangement, then the document conveniently provides a stable starting
point from which to iterate. Indeed, it <em>should</em> adapt along with the project
that it governs.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>With the above points in mind, I've been putting together a draft governance
framework to cover how the OCaml.org domain name is managed.  It's been a
quiet work-in-progress for some time and I'll be getting in touch with
maintainers of specific projects soon.  Once I've had a round of reviews, I'll
be sharing it more widely and posting it here!</p>

<p>I'm speaking to the <a href="http://joinef.com">Entrepreneur First</a> cohort this morning about the future of resilient, distributed systems and what I'm working on to get us there.  Firstly, I'm describing the kinds of solutions we have today, the great things they offer developers as well as the issues they create. This leads into the new toolstack we're creating, called the MISO stack, and the benefits and trade-offs.</p>

<p>I'm spending more time talking about <a href="http://openmirage.org">Mirage OS</a> -- the 'M' in the MISO stack -- because the workflow we've developed here underpins how we build, deploy and maintain such applications at scale. As an example of how things can work, I point at my earlier post on how to go from <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/from-jekyll-to-unikernel-in-fifty-lines">jekyll to unikernel</a>.  This uses TravisCI to do all the hard work and all the relevant artefacts, including the final VM, can be version-controlled through Git. I actually deployed this post while the audience was watching, so that I could point at <a href="http://travisci.org/amirmc/amirmc.github.com">the build logs</a>.</p>

<p>One of the use cases for our toolstack is to make it possible for individuals to create and maintain their own piece of the cloud, a project called <a href="http://nymote.org">Nymote</a>, which will also make it possible to run the <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/working-on-the-internet-of-my-things/">Internet of <em>my</em> Things</a> -- which itself is related to another things I'm working on, such the <a href="http://hubofallthings.com">Hub of All Things - HAT</a> and the <a href="http://usercentricnetworking.eu">User Centric Networking</a> projects.</p>

<p>This is an exciting summer for all the tools we're putting together, since we've recently <a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/announcing-mirage-20-release">announced Mirage OS v2.0</a>, which now works on ARM, are going full steam ahead with <a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/introducing-irmin">Irmin</a> and working hard on improvements to the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/tasks/platform.html">OCaml ecosystem</a>. It's a great time to explore these projects, learn a new language and build awesome stuff.</p>

        <h2><a class="post-title" href="/winning-seedhack-5-2014">Winning Seedhack 5.0</a></h2>
        

<p class="footnote">[This story was also a
    <a href="http://seedcamp.com/seedhack-5-0/">guest post</a>
    on the <a href="http://seedcamp.com">Seedcamp</a> blog.]</p>


<p>A couple of weeks ago, I took part in <a href="http://seedhack.com">Seedhack 5.0</a>, on the theme
of life-logging. My team were overall winners with Clarity, our calendar
assistant app. This post captures my experiences of what happened over the
weekend, the process of how we built the app and the main things I learned.
You'll find out what Clarity is at the end -- just like we did.</p>

<h3>Meeting people and pitches on Friday</h3>

<p>The weekend began with some information on the APIs available to us, which
was followed by pizza and mingling with everyone. I spoke to a few people
about what they were working on and the technologies they were used to. It
was good to find a mixture of experience and I was specifically looking for
folks with an interest in functional programming -- that's how I first met
Vlad over Twitter.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/vla_ve/statuses/485083697172185088"><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-1.jpg" alt="Tweets with Vlad" /></a></p>

<p>After pizza, those people with ideas, even if not fully formed, were invited
to share them with the room. I came in to Seedhack with specific thoughts on
the kind of things I wanted to work on so I spoke about one of those.</p>

<h3>Pitching Personal Clouds</h3>

<p>I described the problem of silos, poor interoperability and how all the
life-logging data should really be owned by the user. That would allow third
parties to request access and provide way more value to users, while
maintaining privacy and security. Building a centralised service makes a lot
of sense in the first instance but what's more disruptive than eschewing the
current model of yet-another-silo and putting the user in control? If that
sounds familiar, it's because I'm trying to solve these problems already.</p>

<p>I'm working on a open source toolstack for building distributed systems that
I call the MISO stack, which is analogous to the LAMP stack of old but
is based on <a href="http://openmirage.org">Mirage OS</a>.  With this stack, I'm putting together a
system to help people create and run their own little piece of the cloud
-- <a href="http://nymote.org">Nymote</a>. The <a href="http://nymote.org/blog/2013/introducing-nymote/">introductory post</a> and my post on
'<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/working-on-the-internet-of-my-things/">The Internet of <em>my</em> Things</a>' has more detail on why I'm working
on this.</p>

<p>For systems like this to be viable, we must be willing to trust them with
the core applications of Email, Contacts and Calendar. Without advanced and
robust options for running these, it's unlikely that anyone (including me)
would want to switch away from the current providers. Of these three
applications, I decided to talk about the contact management solution, since
I happen to have wireframes and thought it might be simpler to implement
something over the weekend.</p>

<!--
Some readers may not be convinced but I like to recall a 1977 quote by Ken
Olsen, Cofounder and CEO of Digital Equipment Corp., who said *"[There is no
reason for any individual to have a computer in his home][olsen]."* We now
carry computers in our pockets (see footnote), so it's perfectly reasonable
to me that we'll all have our own clouds one day.
-->


<p>There was quite a bit of interest in the overall concept but what really
piqued my curiosity was that someone else presented some thoughts around
Calendars and analytics. After a brief chat, we decided to join forces and
tackle the problems of Calendar management. The team had a great mix of
experience from product to design and several of them had worked together
before.</p>

<h3>Thick fog and ambiguity on Friday evening</h3>

<p>We had all decided to work together and we knew it would be on the problem
of calendar management and analytics. We were fired up but it quickly became
obvious that was <em>all</em> we knew.</p>

<p>The next four to five <em>hours</em> were spent discussing the rough shape of what
we were going to build, what specific problem we thought we were solving and
whether there were enough people with such a problem to care.</p>

<p>We had a look at each other's calendars and talked about how we each use
them and the things we like and dislike about them. For example, I have
around nine calendars and I curate them carefully, adding contextual
information and sometimes even correcting old events to reflect what
happened. We even bounced around the idea of the contact management app
several times as well as a few other ideas that came up during the
discussions.</p>

<p>These conversations took a while and it seemed like we were going around in
circles. Despite this, it didn't feel particularly frustrating. I realised
that the same sticking point was coming up repeatedly because we were
forcing ourselves to imagine a prototypical customer and the problems <em>they</em>
might have. This was never going to work since we wouldn't have time to go
and find such people and do basic customer development. Far better to
constrain the problem to something <em>we</em> experience so that we can look to
ourselves for initial customer feedback.  Once we did this, things seemed to
go a little faster and taking breaks for food helped us keep our energy up.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/inthecompanyof/status/485463322020839424"><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-2.jpg" alt="Mani grabbing falafel for dinner" /></a></p>

<p>There were a few occasions where I looked around the room and saw other
teams with their heads down, headphones in, and bashing away at keyboards
-- we hadn't even figured out what we were doing yet.
Despite this, it was a great exercise because it allowed all of us to get a
feel for what aspects each of us cared about most and it helped us form some
kind of shared language for the product.</p>

<p>The only outcome from this first evening was an outline but it was an
important one. It distilled what we what we were going to work on and the
components of it. We did this so we'd have a clear starting point the next
morning and could get going quickly.  Here's a paraphrased version of what
we sent ourselves.</p>

<pre><code class="text">Smart Calendar App.

We are collecting data from mobile and from desktop. 
- Mobile includes:
  - Call logs
  - Location (if we can)
  - Messages
  - What application is being used and when
- Desktop includes:
  - What application is active and timestamps of it
  - Location?
  - Git Logs ... ?
  - Taking logs of their existing calendars.

Working out what people are doing.
- Extrapolating info from active application (e.g browser page)

Present info back via calendar UI
- Need to turn all this information into webcal events

Useful info we want
- Time spent travelling (how much?)
- Time in meetings 
- Time on phone
- Who the meetings/calls were with
- Relevant docs/emails these are linked with
- Use labels
</code></pre>

<p>Then it was time for some late night snacks.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nicolagreco/status/485201493633826818"><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-3.jpg" alt="Midnight snacks" /></a></p>

<p>With one challenge out of the way, the next one was finding somewhere to
sleep for a few hours (Campus was closing from 01:30). I had nothing planned
but luckily for me, a couple of team members had booked a hotel room for the
night. The minor complication was that we had to first find the hotel and
then somehow get six people into a room meant for two -- without the night
manager kicking us out. That's a whole other story, but it suffices to say
that James Bond has nothing to worry about.</p>

<h3>Rays of light and clearing haze on Saturday</h3>

<p>After some card games and a few hours of sleep, we headed back to Campus and
during this walk, we came up with 'Clarity' as the name of the application.</p>

<p>Once we arrived, development began. River volunteered his digital
assets to the cause (i.e. his whole Google life). Mani worked on the Android
app, Vlad on a Chrome extension with Joao pulling in the Google Apps data as
well as combining it with data from the various platform apps. Jeremy worked
on the front-end of the site, while River and I began wireframing the UI and
user flow through the site.</p>

<p>Once the development was well underway, I realised how superfluous 'the
business guys' can be. It would have been easy to simply sit there and let
everyone get on with it but there were other things River and I did while
developers were writing code.</p>

<p><em>Wireframing</em> - We spent time thinking about what a user would actually see
and engage with once they visited the Clarity site. We made a lot of
sketches on paper and this was helpful because communication with the team
was smoother with something to guide the discussion. It also helped to
inform the design work and gave River and I something to show to potential
users.</p>

<p><em>Talk to people</em> - aka early customer development. We already knew that we
were our own customers but it was useful to talk to other people for two
reasons. Firstly, to get an idea of how they use their calendars and whether
they have similar problems to us and secondly, to see what thoughts we
prompt when we describe our solution (or show our wireframes). This led to
useful information on how we should refine the product and and position
ourselves against perceived competition.</p>

<p><em>Refine the product</em> - Going through the wireframing and talking to people
helped us come up with several new ideas for how to display the data back to
users. Some of these seemed great at the time, but after showing some paper
sketches to other people, we realised customers didn't care about certain
things, so we discarded them. Even though Jeremy had already done the work of
putting together the UI for them (sorry, Jeremy!).</p>

<p><em>Examine the competition</em> - After we described what we were working on. A
few people mentioned potential competitors and asked how we were different.
Initially, we didn't know much about these companies but it was something we
could explore while development was underway and consider our positioning.</p>

<p><em>Remind people to regroup</em> - Every few hours, we would make sure everyone
caught up with each other.  We would check that things were going well, share
what we'd learned from talking to people and discuss any technical problems
and possible workarounds -- including changing the scope of the product. The
discussions we'd had on Friday meant that we spent less time debating when
these questions came up during the weekend.</p>

<p><em>Work on the pitch</em> - River and I began working on the pitch from just after
Saturday lunchtime and kept building on it until Sunday afternoon. This,
combined with showing our sketches to people, made it much easier to think
about the story we wanted to tell the audience. In turn, that made it easier
to think about the product development that <em>had</em> to be completed by Sunday.
Especially in terms of a kick-ass demo.</p>

<h3>Bright sunshine and achieving Clarity on Sunday afternoon</h3>

<p>Development carried on through the night and we took a break to watch some
sports via River's laptop -- at this point Clarity was actually logging this
and other events.
The next morning, we reiterated what we needed to
get done for the demo and I was pretty ruthless about practising the pitch.
River and I practised endlessly while everyone else made sure the the
technical pieces were working smoothly. We had a lot of moving parts and
making sure they were glued together seamlessly was important.
At this point, we knew what Clarity was and how to tell its story.</p>

<h3>Introducing Clarity</h3>

<p>We all have calendars and we put a lot of time and effort into managing them
but get very little back. A simple glance at your calendar for the past
month will show you a sea of information with no idea where your time was
actually spent. We believe your calendar should be working harder for you.
Your calendar should give you clarity.</p>

<p><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-5.jpg" alt="Calendar" /></p>

<p>Over the course of the weekend, we built tools that can go through your
calendar and understand the events you're involved in and tie them back to
the relevant emails, documents and people.  With a suite of software that
spans across your GDrive, Chrome and Android, we're able to combine your
calendars with rich, contextual information so you can really understand
what your time is being spent on.</p>

<p><a href="http://clarityapp.me"><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-6.jpg" alt="Clarity summary view" /></a></p>

<p>We built this system and plugged it into River's digital life.
If we take a look at River's summary for the last month, we see that he's
spent around 32 hours in meetings in London last month, despite living in
Sheffield. We can also see that he's spent an hour on the phone with someone
called Lee, but that all of them were short calls. The next person also
totalled an hour on the phone but only across 3 calls.  Already, River has
learned something about the the people he interacts with most and how. We
can also drill down further and see all this activity presented in a
calendar view, except this now represents where his time <em>did</em> go, rather
than where he thought it went. For example, he's most active via text
message between 4pm and 5pm during the week, and we can see that he spent
a few hours watching sports last night.</p>

<p>Clarity can do much more than provide an accurate retrospective view of your
time. Since it interacts with all the important components of your life,
like your phone and laptop, it can even perform helpful actions for you.
For example, say I have a meeting set up with River but I want to reschedule
it. I simply send a text to him as I normally would, suggesting that we move
it to another day. Clarity can pick up that message and is smart enough to
understand its intent, find the relevant calendar event and <em>reschedule
it automatically</em>. River doesn't have to lift a finger and his diary is
always up to date. It's easy to imagine a future where we might never have
to add or edit events ourselves.</p>

<p>Clarity is a smart calendar assistant that understands the context around
you, provides you with insight into your life and helps you seamlessly
organise your future. You can find out more at

<h3>Judging and announcements</h3>

<p>After the pitches, we met a lot of people who had the same problems as we
did with calendar management. Several offered to be beta testers. After
waiting for the judges, prizes were announced and Clarity was declared the
overall winner of Seedhack 5.0!</p>

<h3>Things I learned</h3>

<p>Looking back, there were a lot of things we did which I think
helped us get to the winning slot, so I thought I'd summarise them here.</p>

<p><strong>Think first</strong> - We spent time up front to <em>define</em> what we were
going to work on. I thought this step was crucial as it meant we all
understood the shape of the problem but also the areas that each of us were
interested in.  That helped later in the weekend as we could refer back to
things we discussed on Friday.</p>

<p><strong>Move fast</strong> - Once we did figure out what we were doing, then it was a
matter of building the software to gather and crunch the data. A lot of this
was done in parallel as Jeremy worked on the front-end UI while Mani, Joao
and Vlad took care of the data aggregation, analytics and platform products.
Don't be afraid to throw away ideas if you find that they don't work for
people and remember it's a <em>hackathon</em> (i.e gruesome hacks are the norm).</p>

<p><strong>Remember the demo</strong> - At some point you're going to be forced to stand up
and talk about what you've done. We started thinking about this from
Saturday lunchtime and sketched out the slides and the elements of the app
we wanted to show. This helped inform the UI and technology that we were
building and the pitch never felt like it was rushed.</p>

<p><strong>Practice, practice, practice</strong> - we were told we'd have 3 minutes to
pitch/demo and maybe a few additional questions. I made sure River and I
practised <em>repeatedly</em> to get our time down to 3mins and ensure we getting
across everything we wanted to.  The important thing with such a
short amount of time, is that we were forced to <em>cut</em> things out as well as
ensure we emphasised the main points. It was a ruthless exercise in saying
'no'. During the actual pitches, we realised everyone was taking longer
(without repercussions), so I added an extra 30 seconds to cover the
potential market sizes and business models.</p>

<p><strong>Leave artefacts</strong> - After the pitches, we knew that we had to take the
site down. It was built at high speed and in a way that ended up exposing
someone's data to the internet at large (thanks, River!). It might have
been somewhat easier to build something using faked data that we could
happily share the URL to and leave online.  On the other hand, our demo
would not have been half as compelling if we weren't running it real-time
on live data.</p>

<h3>Looking to the future</h3>

<p>This is a product we all want to use and the team is interested in taking
this forward. There are a lot of things to think about and many
things we would build differently so we're discussing the next steps. For
example, there are likely ways to empower the end-users to control their
data and give them more flexibility, even though the work at the hackathon
was already quite impressive. Given how well Seedhack went, you might even
see us at <a href="http://seedcamp.com/events/seedcamp-week-london/">Seedcamp Week</a> later in the year. If you think this is
something you'd like to work on with us,
<a href="mailto:amirmc+clarity@gmail.com">do get in touch</a>!</p>

<p>To wrap things up, here's a victory selfie!</p>

        <h2><a class="post-title" href="/writing-planet-in-pure-ocaml">Writing Planet in pure OCaml</a></h2>
        <p>I've been learning OCaml for some time now but not really had a problem that
I wanted to solve. As such, my progress has been rather slow and sporadic
and I only make time for exercises when I'm travelling. In order to focus my
learning, I have to identify and tackle something specific. That's usually
the best way to advance and I recently found something I can work on.</p>

<p>As I've been trying to write more blog posts, I want to be able to keep as
much content on my own site as possible and syndicate my posts out to other
sites I run. Put simply, I want to be able to take multiple feeds from
different sources and merge them into one feed, which will be served from
some other site. In addition, I also want to render that feed as HTML on a
webpage. All of this has to remain within the OCaml toolchain so it can be
used as part of <a href="http://openmirage.org/">Mirage</a> (i.e. I can use it when
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/from-jekyll-to-unikernel-in-fifty-lines">building unikernels</a>).</p>

<p>What I'm describing might sound familiar and there's a well-known tool that
does this called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)">Planet</a>. It's a 'river of news' feed reader, which
aggregates feeds and can display posts on webpages and you can find the
<a href="http://www.planetplanet.org">original Planet</a> and it's successor <a href="http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/docs/index.html">Venus</a>, both written in Python.
However, Venus seems to be unmaintained as there are a number of
<a href="https://github.com/rubys/venus/issues">unresolved issues and pull requests</a>, which have been
languishing for quite some time with no discussion. There does appear to be
a more active Ruby implementation called <a href="http://feedreader.github.io/">Pluto</a>, with recent commits and
no reported issues.</p>

<!-- 
    \[Rant: Frankly, the naming of these versions leaves a lot to be desired.
    When you know exactly what you're supposed to Google for you're fine, but
    until then you're just on a random-walk through space websites. I'm
    lucky I managed to get to the Wikipedia page.\] 
-->


<h3>Benefits of a Planet in pure OCaml</h3>

<p>Although I could use the one of the above options, it would be much more
useful to keep everything within the OCaml ecosystem.  This way I can make
the best use of the <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2566628">unikernel approach</a> with Mirage (i.e lean,
single-purpose appliances). Obviously, the existing options don't lend
themselves to this approach and there are <a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1349&amp;group_id=1&amp;atid=101">known bugs</a> as a lot has
changed on the web since Planet Venus (e.g the adoption of HTML5).
Having said that, I can learn a lot from the existing implementations and
I'm glad I'm not embarking into completely uncharted territory.</p>

<p>In addition, the OCaml version doesn't need to (and <em>shouldn't</em>) be written
as one monolithic library.  Instead, pulling together a collection of
smaller, reusable libraries that present clear interfaces to each other
would make things much more maintainable. This would bring substantially
greater benefits to everyone and <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/">OPAM</a> can manage the dependencies.</p>

<!--
    OPAM makes managing dependencies easy so having a number of single-
    purpose libraries is A Good Thing and costs almost nothing.  This 
    approach has already worked well with examples like an [IP address 
    library][ipaddr] and the [OCaml markdown library][OMD], which can be 
    used by multiple projects.
-->


<h3>Breaking down the problem</h3>

<p>The first cut is somewhat straightforward as we have a piece that deals with
the consumption and manipulation of feeds and another that takes the result
and emits HTML. This is also how the original Planet is put together, with a
library called <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/feedparser/">feedparser</a> and another for templating pages.</p>

<p>For the feed-parsing aspect, I can break it down further by considering Atom
and RSS feeds separately and then even further by thinking about how to (1)
consume such feeds and (2) output them. Then there is the HTML component,
where it may be necessary to consider existing representations of HTML. These
are not new ideas and since I'm claiming that individual pieces might be
useful then it's worth finding out which ones are already available.</p>

<h4>Existing components</h4>

<p>The easiest way to find existing libraries is via the
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/packages">OPAM package list</a>. Some quick searches for <code>RSS</code>, <code>XML</code>, <code>HTML</code>
and <code>net</code> bring up a lot of packages. The most relevant of these seem to be
<a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/xmlm/xmlm.1.2.0/">xmlm</a>, <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/ocamlrss/ocamlrss.2.2.2/">ocamlrss</a>, <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/cow/cow.0.9.1/">cow</a> and maybe <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/xmldiff/xmldiff.0.1/">xmldiff</a>. I noticed that
nothing appears, when searching for <code>Atom</code>, but I do know that <code>cow</code> has an
Atom module for creating feeds. In terms of turning feeds into pages and
HTML, I'm aware of <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/blob/master/script/rss2html.ml">rss2html</a> used on the <a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml</a> website and parts of
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/ocamlnet/ocamlnet.3.7.3/">ocamlnet</a> that may be relevant (e.g <code>nethtml</code> and <code>netstring</code>) as well as
<code>cow</code>.  There is likely to be other code I'm missing but this is useful as a
first pass.</p>

<p>Overall, a number of components are already out there but it's not obvious
if they're compatible (e.g html) and there are still gaps (e.g atom). Since
I also want to minimise dependencies, I'll try and use whatever works but
may ultimately have to roll my own. Either way, I can learn from what
already exists. Perhaps I'm being overconfident but if I can break things
down sensibly and keep the scope constrained then this should be an
achievable project.</p>

<h3>The first (baby) steps - an Atom parser</h3>

<p>As this is an exercise for me to learn OCaml by solving a problem, I need to
break it down into bite-size pieces and take each one at a time. Practically
speaking, this means limiting the scope to be as narrow as possible while
still producing a useful result <em>for me</em>.  That last part is important as I
have specific needs and it's likely that the first thing I make won't be
particularly interesting for many others.</p>

<p>For my specific use-case, I'm only interested in dealing with Atom feeds as
that's what I use on my site and others I'm involved with. Initial feedback
is that creating an Atom parser will be the bulk of the work and I should
start by defining the types. To keep this manageable, I'm only going to deal
with my own feeds instead of attempting a fully compliant parser (in other
words, I'll only consider the subset of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">RFC4287</a> that's relevant to me).
Once I can parse, merge and write such feeds I should be able to iterate
from there.</p>

<p>To make my requirements more concrete:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only consider <em>my own</em> Atom feeds for now</li>
<li>Initially, be able to parse and emit just one Atom feed</li>
<li>Then be able to merge 2+ feeds, specifically:

<ul>
<li>Use tag-based feeds from my personal site as starting points</li>
<li>Be able to de-dupe content</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No database or storage (construct it afresh every time)</li>
<li>Minimise library dependencies</li>
</ul>


<!-- 
    Perhaps these requirements are already too much and I may decide to dial
    it down even further (e.g just figure out how to consume *one* feed),
    but I won't really know until I get started. For example, I can imagine
    that I'll need one bunch of code to deal with Atom feeds and then
    perhaps I can make another (feedparser), that depends on it and others
    to deal with general feeds.
-->


<h4>Timeframes and workflow</h4>

<p>I've honestly no idea how long this might take and I'm treating it as a
side-project. I know there are many people out there who could produce a
working version of everything in a week or two but I'm not one of them (yet).
There are also <em>a lot</em> of ancillary things I need to learn on the way, like
packaging, improving my knowledge of Git and dealing with build systems. If
I had to put a vague time frame on this, I'd be thinking in months rather
than weeks.  It might even be the case that others start work on parts of
this and ship things sooner but that's great as I'll probably be able to use
whatever they create and move further along the chain.</p>

<p>In terms of workflow, everything will be done in the open, warts and all, and
I expect to make embarrassing mistakes as I go. You can follow along on my
freshly created <a href="https://github.com/amirmc/ocamlatom">OCaml Atom</a> repo, and I'll be using the issue tracker as
the main way of dealing with bugs and features. Let the fun begin.</p>

        <h2><a class="post-title" href="/iot-brave-new-world-or-evolved-m2m">IoT - Brave New World or Simply evolved M2M?</a></h2>
        <p>I was at an <a href="http://www.cambridgewireless.co.uk/events/article/default.aspx?objid=43697">event</a> run by Cambridge Wireless today on the Internet of
Things.  These are my notes. Although I've named people, I'm paraphrasing a
lot so best not to treat anything you read here as a direct quote.</p>

<p>There were a few audience polls conducted using little keypads they handed
out. There were only 30-ish keypads so it's not necessarily indicative of
how the whole room felt.  I took some hasty pics of a few of the slides
(mainly the poll results) so apologies for the poor quality.</p>

<h3>"The Enterprise and the Internet of Things - Evolution or Revolution?"</h3>

<p><em>John Hicklin, Principal Consultant | Commercial Enterprise Markets, CGI UK</em></p>

<p>Nowadays, you can walk into the C-suite and start a discussion about the IoT.
They may not know what they're talking about but someone's told them they
need to be thinking about it.  But what is IoT?</p>

<p>One of the problems in industry you go to your Director and you explain this
new tech and all the awesome things you can do with it and he asks the
dreaded question, "So what?"  Example of the Connected Toothbrush. With a
connected toothbrush you can automatically have a remote relationship with
your dentist.  But he already drives a BMW and it's not clear how he
benefits from that.  He wants you in the office where, every time you open
your mouth, he sees new business development opportunities.  For the moment,
he neither needs nor wants a remote relationship with you. Leads to the
question about who's going to sign up for the business case.</p>

<p>Number of key areas that need to be addressed (paraphrased):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Crack open the Data</strong>: We are awash with data but don't know how to use
it. Problem with clients is that they really buy into the vision but they
have a lot of legacy systems (green screens!) which already run things.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identifying value</strong>(?): Volume is not a sign of success.  Need to know
where the value is, which means understanding it. e.g is Enron. Thousands of
documents, accountants all over the place with tons of data. It took a small
team of a few researchers doing a case study that discovered no tax had ever
been paid.  They got to the right data and asked the right questions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Connectivity</strong>(?): M2M has grown in a silo'd manner where a device takes
data and sends it to one place.  This needs to open up more and give access
to other areas of business.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Business operations</strong>: People matter too. Process changes, systems that
allow real-time decisions, empowering individuals.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, IoT is an enabler for a number of wider trends. IoT can improve
operational efficiency <strong>and</strong> enhance customer experience.  Normally these
are in conflict with each-other. However, if we just get into a tech-fest,
then we might just end up with a large number of failures as we've seen with
'Big Data'</p>

<p><strong>Poll - Which (categories of) business-related infrastructure categories
are most urgently needed for building the Internet of Things.</strong></p>

<h3>"Overcoming the Internet of Things Connectivity Challenge"</h3>

<p><em>David Dunn, Software Engineer, Electric Imp</em></p>

<p>Electric Imp aims to help people in Product Development in the IoT space,
namely with the connectivity problem.  The name 'IMP' came from 'Internet
Messaging Processor'. Name is also from Terry Pratchett who's stories had
devices that contained an imp which did the work :)</p>

<p>Building connected devices is difficult. Have to be secure, easy to set up.
There are many choices for connectivity, problems with managing the code on
the devices.  Electric Imp picked wifi and decided to do it well.  This
satisfies a lot of markets but not all.</p>

<p>Side story of the <a href="http://www.proofpoint.com/threatinsight/posts/your-fridge-is-full-of-spam-part-ll-details.php">hacked fridge sending spam emails</a>.</p>

<p>Things run through Electric Imp system and they manage the security. It's
security as a service.  Electric Imp manages deployment of your code too so
developers can just push code and it will end up on all their devices.</p>

<p>Simplicity comes from one-step setup.  It's optical and uses a smartphone
and flashes the screen, which sends the wifi SSID and credentials to the
device (via a sensor). Customer code runs within a VM on top of with custom
OS (impOS) taking care of I/O (TLS-encrypted wifi connection to service).</p>

<p>Difficult to debug devices in the field so cloud based- service helps with
that. They do embedded stuff on the device and cloud stuff in the cloud.
There's another VM in the cloud that's paired with the VM on the device.
Heavy lifting can happens elsewhere so no need to parse JSON on the device
itself.</p>

<p>Q - How do you deal with identity of units?<br/>
A - Imps have unique serials and the devices they're plugged into are also unique (missed how).</p>

<h3>"Real-life experiences from rolling out M2M networks and how we can learn from these in the shift to IoT"</h3>

<p><em>Jon Lewis, Chief Innovation Officer, Plextek Consulting</em></p>

<p>Plextek was working in this field when it was called 'telemetry'.  One of
the earliest things they worked on was 'Lojack' (car tracking). Things then
shifted to 'smart cities' and now people talk about 'IoT' and want consumer
devices with consumer volumes.</p>

<p>2014 has got to be year of IoT. However, still some way from business cases
as it's too expensive to simply track your cat (approx £100 set up fee and
then around £30 pcm).</p>

<p>Deployment often costs more than then the sensor devices. c.f street
lighting systems.  Choice of radio system is critical.  Projects in
UK/Europe are about incremental cost savings with pay-back in less than 5yrs.
In industrialising countries, there is new build which is easier then
retrofit.  Urbanisation creates strain and demand. Local issues relate to
the Spectrum issues and local regulations (e.g mandate to use govt
encryption streams).  Data privacy is also concern as we don't know who
holds the monkey. That's made even more difficult when you go abroad.  Local
politics also matters.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Big opportunity in B2C: but need consolidation in B2B markets to get
necessary economies of scale</li>
<li>Big B2B opportunity in developing countries: but is tough and needs local
partners</li>
<li>Application developers need common platforms: to lower R&amp;D costs and
enable access to global markets</li>
<li>Whole value chain needs to work: building an ecosystem that connects
application developers to markets is key to achieving scale</li>
</ul>


<h3>"The role of LTE in M2M"</h3>

<p><em>Georg Steimel, Head of M2M Solutions, Huawei</em></p>

<p>About Huawei
- Three businesses: Carrier network, Consumer business, Enterprise business
- Revenues of $39Bn, No2. Telecom solution provider, 150k+ employees
worldwide</p>

<p>Georg is in Consumer branch for Europe.  Huawei wants to be top M2M module
vendor in the coming years.  They're operator and system integrator agnostic.</p>

<p>Tech evolution brings new opportunities. Mobile data traffic needs, Network
upgrading etc. Ave user expected to generated 1G data traffic per month
(currently 63MB today) and there are predicted to be 50Bn+ devices.
Examples of users are highly varied including monitoring of pregnant cows.</p>

<p>Challenges for mass rollout are a scattered market requiring complex
solutions.  Alignment of all parties in one adequate business model is quite
tricky, esp when it comes to customer ownership. Should consider the value
chain.</p>

<p>Complex business model:</p>

<ul>
<li>From sales to service</li>
<li>Many stakeholders

<ul>
<li>Who pays, how much, to whom, for what service, for what benefits?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Individual benefit must exceed cost

<ul>
<li>Realistic pricing</li>
<li>Appropriate effort</li>
<li>Total benefit, direct vs indirect TCO</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Amount of data generated is also going to be huge.  Smart meters in German
households could send over 4TB per day, which is a huge strain for mobile
networks.</p>

<p>LTE advantage for M2M is obviously bandwidth but that's only relevant to a
few verticals (signage, routers, and in-car entertainment). Low latency is
more important for industrial alarms and medical devices.</p>

<h3>"Using networked visualisation for better decision making"</h3>

<p><em>Fredrik Sjostedt, Vice President | Corporate Marketing, Barco Ltd</em></p>

<p>Barco does a lot of visualising information. Displays for radiographers,
stuff in cinema screens, screens in flight simulators and a lot more.</p>

<p>Need to take in data from sensors, display relevant information and allow
operators to make SMART decisions.  e.g number of CCTV cameras in London -
who's looking at them? Real 'Big Data' step is at the operator level.</p>

<p>Important to use standards, rather than proprietary systems.</p>

<p>Q - In transport visualisation do you have low enough latency to get
real-time info?<br/>
A- Yes, e.g on a route in Brazil near Sao Palo it's closed dues to fog.
Real-time info important for understanding the whole route.</p>

<h3>"Regulatory backdrop on IP and standards issues for the M2M eco-system"</h3>

<p><em>Justin Hill, Co-Head of the Patent Prosecution Group and Purvi Parekh, Co-Head of International Telecoms, Olswang</em></p>

<p><strong>Purvi</strong> on the Regulatory environment<br/>
No tailor made regulation v high regulatory focus. Regulatory focus from
leading bodies and many of them said that existing regulation can be amended
to facilitate M2M/IoT.  Made more complicated by lack of globally agreed
definition of IoT (which make it difficult for lawyers).  There's generally
promotion of Open Standards.  EU does believe that this is v important.
People should read the RAND report (Nov 2013), commissioned by the EU to
examine if there should be standards.</p>

<p><strong>Justin</strong> on IP issues<br/>
With any standardisation process, you're hoping to increase adoption with
the trade-off of Right of IPR owners.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_and_non-discriminatory_licensing">FRAND</a> (fair, reasonable, and
non-discriminatory terms) are also important but that's also debatable.
When considering how to protect IPR, it's worth comparing whole-system
claims with protecting at different layers of the tech/value stack and build
a portfolio.</p>

<h3>"The impact of autonomous systems on surface transport"</h3>

<p><em>Paul Copping, Corporate Development Director, TRL</em></p>

<p>TRL is the Transport Research Laboratory.  Did some work to consider the
impact of autonomous transport on the overall value chain.  Some of things
we're trying now with autonomous driving have been successfully done in the
past by other means (e.g car tracking a lane with magnets).</p>

<p><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/cw-iot-new-world/cw-iot-new-world-4.jpg" alt="Transport Value Chain" /></p>

<h3>"Connected Products - Designing for Scale"</h3>

<p><em>Pilgrim Beart, Founder Director, 1248-io</em></p>

<p>What is IoT?  Humans don't scale.  Population is predicted to tail off at
around 9Bn.  Connected devices are growing and the rate of change is
exponential (and increasing).  In the 90s we used to be our own sysadmin
with maybe one device.  Now we have several and some cloud services.  In the
future there will be many more and they'll have to manage themselves. There
are different problem you face as you go from 1 to 10 to 100 to 10000 to
1MM+ deployed devices.  Issues ranging from device updates al the way to
regulation and externalities that affect your business.</p>

<p>In 10 years time, when all is said and done, we won't be calling it the
Internet of Things. It'll just be called the Internet.</p>

<p>Q from an application developers perspective wht would you different earlier
in your development if you were to go back and start again<br/>
A - AlertMe started a bit too early so there were a lot things were not
off-the-shelf. Had to build. Right now can see a lot people reinventing the
wheel but shouldn't need to do this.</p>

<h3>"A new standard to connect the Internet of Everything"</h3>

<p><em>Antony Rix, Senior Consultant, TTP</em></p>

<p>One of the things TTP works on are wireless standards.</p>

<p>The size of the grey blobs are in an indication of market size.<br/>
<img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/cw-iot-new-world/cw-iot-new-world-5.jpg" alt="IoT Market Segments" /></p>

<p>Users will expect things to cost pretty much the same as they did before.
Cost will be critical and as we buy things we generally still expect them to
last for years.</p>

<p>TTP Matrix is a proprietary standard specifically for use by low-cost
wireless connected devices.  It's optimised for efficient use of radio
spectrum, long range, low cost and power efficient.  Use-case example
(DisplayData) are the pricing labels on supermarket.  50k products running
through only 3 gateways (other standards would find this difficult). Low
power consumption means a battery can last 10 years.</p>

<p><strong>Poll - Which (categories of) technical / architecture building blocks are
most urgently needed for building the Internet of Things.</strong>
<img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/cw-iot-new-world/cw-iot-new-world-6.jpg" alt="Poll results" /></p>

<h3>Debate</h3>

<p>Interesting discussion of Humans role in IoT.  For home consumer devices
people may not want to have to make any decisions (completely automated) but
corporates my want all information in order to integrate and decide.</p>

<p>How quickly will this happen? It's difficult to say when you're in the
middle of it. We'll know it's happened after the event. It takes about a
decade for things to get things in to mature in the market. On the other
hand, it's happening.</p>

<p><strong>Poll - Big and small data - Which statement do you agree with most/least</strong>  <br/>
I only got a pic of the latter but it's the inverse of the former
(unsurprisingly).<br/>
