        <h2><a class="post-title" href="/brewing-miso-to-serve-nymote">Brewing MISO to serve Nymote</a></h2>
        
<p>The <a href="http://nymote.org/blog/2013/introducing-nymote/">mission of Nymote</a> is to enable the creation of resilient
decentralised systems that incorporate privacy from the ground up, so that
users retain control of their networks and data.  To achieve this, we
reconsider all the old assumptions about how software is created in light of
the problems of the modern, networked environment.  Problems that will become
even more pronounced as more devices and sensors find their way into our lives.</p>

<p>We want to make it simple for anyone to be able to run a piece of the cloud
for their own purposes and the first three applications Nymote targets are
Mail, Contacts and Calendars, but to get there, we first have to create solid
foundations.</p>

<h3 id="defining-the-bedrock">Defining the bedrock</h3>

<p>In order to create applications that work for the user, we first have to
create a robust and reliable software stack that takes care of fundamental
problems for us. In other words, to be able to assemble the applications we
desire, we must first construct the correct building blocks.</p>

<p>We’ve taken a clean-slate approach so that we can build long-lasting solutions
with all the benefits of hindsight but none of the baggage. As
mentioned in earlier posts, there are three main components of the stack,
which are: <a href="http://nymote.org/software/mirage/">Mirage</a> (OS for the Cloud/IoT), <a href="http://nymote.org/software/irmin/">Irmin</a> (distributed datastore)
and <a href="http://nymote.org/software/signpost/">Signpost</a> (identity and connectivity) - all built using the <a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml</a>
programming language.</p>

<h4 id="using-the-miso-stack-to-build-nymote">Using the MISO stack to build Nymote</h4>

<p>As you’ve already noticed, there’s a useful acronym for the above tools —
<strong>MISO</strong>. Each of the projects mentioned is a serious undertaking in its own
right and each is likely to be impactful as a stand-alone concept.  However,
when used together we have the opportunity to create applications and services
with high levels of security, scalability and stability, which are not easy to
achieve using other means. </p>

<p>In other words, MISO is the <em>toolstack</em> that we’re using to build Nymote —
Nymote is the <em>decentralised system</em> that works for its users.</p>

<p>Each of the projects is at a different phase but they have all have made great
strides over the last year.</p>

<h4 id="mirage">Mirage</h4>

<p>Mirage — a library operating system that constructs unikernels — is the most
mature part of the stack. I previously wrote about the
<a href="http://nymote.org/blog/2014/announcing-first-mirage-release/">Mirage 1.0 release</a> and only six months later we had an
<a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/announcing-mirage-20-release">impressive 2.0 release</a>, with continuing advances throughout the year.
We achieved major milestones such as the ability to deploy unikernels to
ARM-based devices, as well as a clean-slate implementation of the transport
layer security (TLS) protocol.</p>

<p>In addition to the development efforts, there have also been many
presentations to audiences, ranging from <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/describing-miso-entrepreneur-first-2014/">small groups of startups</a>
all the way to <a href="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6443_-_en_-_saal_2_-_201412271245_-_trustworthy_secure_modular_operating_system_engineering_-_hannes_-_david_kaloper.html#video">prestigious keynotes</a> with 1000+ attendees.  Ever
since we’ve had ARM support, the talks themselves have been delivered from
unikernels running on Cubieboards and you can see the growing collection of
slides at <a href="http://decks.openmirage.org">decks.openmirage.org</a>.</p>

<p>All of these activities have led to a tremendous increase in public awareness
of unikernels and the value they can bring to developing robust, modern
software as well as the promise of <a href="https://medium.com/@darrenrush/after-docker-unikernels-and-immutable-infrastructure-93d5a91c849e">immutable infrastructure</a>.
As more people look to get involved and contribute to the codebase, we’ve also
begun curating a set of <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Pioneer-Projects">Pioneer Projects</a>, which are suitable for a
range of skill-levels.</p>

<p>You can find much more information on all the activities of 2014 in the
comprehensive <a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/2014-in-review">Mirage review post</a>. As it’s the most mature
component of the MISO stack, anyone interested in the <em>development of code</em>
towards Nymote should join the <a href="http://lists.xenproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mirageos-devel">Mirage mailing list</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="irmin">Irmin</h4>

<p>Irmin — a library to persist and synchronize distributed data structures —
made significant progress last year. It’s based on the principles of Git, the
distributed version control system, and allows developers to choose the
appropriate combination of consistency, availability and partition tolerance
for their needs.</p>

<p>Early last year Irmin was released as an alpha with the ability to speak
‘fluent Git’ and by the summer, it was supporting user-defined merge
operations and fast in-memory views.  A couple of summer projects improved the
<a href="http://gazagnaire.org/pub/FGM15.pdf">merge strategies</a> and synchronisation strategies, while an
external project — Xenstore — used Irmin to <a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/introducing-irmin-in-xenstore">add fault-tolerance</a>.</p>

<p>More recent work has involved a big clean-up in the user-facing API (with nice
<a href="http://samoht.github.io/irmin/">developer documentation</a>) and a cleaner high-level REST API.
Upcoming work includes proper documentation of the REST API, which means Irmin
can more easily be used in non-OCaml projects, and full integration with
Mirage projects. </p>

<p>Irmin is already being used to create
<a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/imaplet-lwt/imaplet-lwt.0.1.3/">a version controlled IMAP server</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/samoht/dog">a version controlled distributed log system</a>. It’s no surprise
that the first major release is coming <a href="https://github.com/mirage/irmin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.0.0">very soon</a>!</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h4 id="signpost">Signpost</h4>

<p>Signpost will be a collection of libraries that aims to provide identity and
connectivity between devices.  Forming efficient connections between
end-points is becoming ever more important as the number of devices we own
increases. These devices need to be able to recognise and reach each-other,
regardless of their location on the network or the obstacles in between. </p>

<p>This is very much a nascent project and it involves a lot of work on
underlying libraries to ensure that security aspects are properly considered.
As such, we must take great care in how we implement things and be clear about
any trade-offs we make. Our thoughts are beginning to converge on a design we
think will work and that we would entrust with our own data, but we’re
treating this as a case of ‘Here Be Dragons’.  This is a critical piece of the
stack and we’ll share what we learn as we chart our way towards it.</p>

<p>Even though we’re at the design stage of Signpost, we did substantial work
last year to create the libraries we might use for implementation.  A
particularly exciting one is <a href="https://github.com/MagnusS/jitsu">Jitsu</a> — which stands for Just In Time
Summoning of Unikernels. This is a DNS server that spawns unikernels in
response to DNS requests and boots them in real-time with no perceptible lag
to the end user.  In other words, it makes much more efficient use of
resources and significantly reduces latency of services for end-users —
services are only run <em>when</em> they need to be, in the <em>places</em> they need to be. </p>

<p>There’s also been lots of efforts on other libraries that will help us
<em>iterate towards</em> a complete solution. Initially, we will use pre-existing
implementations but in time we can take what we’ve learned and create more
robust alternatives. Some of the libraries are listed below (but note the
friendly disclaimers!). </p>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/dsheets/ocaml-libmacaroons">Bindings to libmacaroons</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ocaml">OCaml</h4>

<p><a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml</a> is a mature, powerful and highly pragmatic language.  It’s
proven ideal for creating robust systems applications and
<a href="http://ocaml.org/learn/companies.html">many others</a> also recognise this.  We’re using it to create all the
tools you’ve read about so far and we’re also helping to improve the ecosystem
around it.</p>

<p>One of the major things we’ve been involved with is the coordination of the
OCaml Platform, which combines the OCaml compiler with a coherent set of tools
and workflows to be more productive in the language and speed up development
time.  We presented the first major release of these efforts at OCaml 2014 and
you can <a href="http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2014/ocaml2014_7.pdf">read the abstract</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxhtpQ5nJHg&amp;list=UUP9g4dLR7xt6KzCYntNqYcw">watch the video</a>.</p>

<p>There’s more to come, as we continue to improve the tooling and also support
the community in <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/towards-governance-framework-for-ocamlorg">other ways</a>.</p>

<h3 id="early-steps-towards-applications">Early steps towards applications</h3>

<p>Building blocks are important but we also need to push towards working
applications.  There are different approaches we’ve taken to this, which
include building prototypes, wireframing use-cases and implementing features
with other toolstacks.  Some of this work is also part of a larger
<a href="http://usercentricnetworking.eu">EU funded project</a>* and below are brief summaries of the things we’ve
done so far. We’ll expand on them as we do more over time.</p>

<p><strong>Mail</strong> - As mentioned above, a prototype IMAP server exists (<a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/imaplet-lwt/imaplet-lwt.0.1.3/">IMAPlet</a>)
which uses Irmin to store data. This is already able to connect to a client to
serve mail. The important feature is that it’s an IMAP server which is version
controlled in the backend and can expose a REST API from the mailstore quite
easily.</p>

<p><strong>Contacts</strong> - We first made wireframe mockups of the features we might like
in a contacts app (to follow in later post) and then built a
<a href="https://github.com/yansh/contacts-app">draft implementation</a>. To get here, code was first written in OCaml
and then put through the <a href="http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/">js_of_ocaml</a> compiler. This is valuable as it
takes us closer to a point where we can build networks using our address books
and have the system take care of sharing details in a privacy-conscious manner
and with minimal maintenance. The <a href="http://yansnotes.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/work-summary-ocaml-labs.html">summary post</a> has more detail.</p>

<p><strong>Calendar</strong> - This use-case was approached in a completely different way as
part of a hackathon last year. A rough but functional prototype was built over
one weekend, with a team formed at the event.  It was centralised but it
tested the idea that a service which integrates intimately with your life (to
the point of being very invasive) can provide disproportionate benefits.  The
<a href="http://seedcamp.com/seedhack-5-0/">experience report</a> describes the weekend and our app — Clarity —
won first place. This was <em>great</em> validation that the features are desirable
so we need to work towards a decentralised, privacy-conscious version.</p>

<h3 id="time-to-get-involved">Time to get involved!</h3>

<p>The coming year represents the best time to be working on the MISO stack and
using it to make Nymote a reality.  All source code is publicly available and
the projects are varied enough that there is something for everyone.  Browse
through issues, consider the <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Pioneer-Projects">projects</a> or simply write online and
share with us the things you’d like to see.
This promises to be an exciting year!</p>

        <h2><a class="post-title" href="/unikernels-for-everyone">Unikernels for everyone!</a></h2>
        
<p>Many people have now set up unikernels for blogs, documenting their
experiences for others to follow.  Even more important is that people are
going beyond static sites to build unikernels that provide more complicated
services and solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>To help newcomers get started, there are now even more posts that that use
different tools and target different deployment methods.  Below are summaries
of some of the posts I found interesting and that will make it easier for you
try out different ways of creating and deploying your unikernels.</p>

<h3 id="unikernel-blogs-with-mirageos">Unikernel blogs with MirageOS</h3>

<p>Mindy picked up where the <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/from-jekyll-to-unikernel-in-fifty-lines/">first set of instructions</a>
finished and described her work to get an Octopress blog running on Amazon EC2.
As one of the first people outside the core team to work on this, she had a
lot of interesting experiences — which included getting into the Mirage
networking stack to debug an issue and submit a bugfix!  More recently, she
also wrote a couple of excellent posts on <em>why</em> she uses a unikernel for her
blog.  These posts cover the security concerns (and responsibility) of running
networked services on today’s Internet and the importance of owning your
content — both ideas are at the heart of the work behind <a href="http://nymote.org/">Nymote</a> and are
well worth reading.</p>

<p>Ian took a different path to AWS deployment by using Vagrant and Test Kitchen
to to get his static site together and build his unikernel, and then Packer to
create the images for deployment to EC2.  All succinctly explained with code
available on GitHub for others to try out!</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Ian on</em> <a href="https://github.com/iw/mirage-jekyll">“Mirage with Jekyll on Amazon EC2”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Toby wanted to put together a blog that was a little more complicated than a
traditional static site, with specific features like subdomains based on tags
and the ability to set future dates for posts. He also pulled in some other
libraries so he can use Mustache for sever-side rendering, where his blog
posts and metadata are stored as JSON and rendered on request.</p>

</ul>

<p>Chris saw others working to get unikernel blogs on EC2 and decide he’d try
getting his up and running on Linode instead.  He is the first person to
deploy his unikernel to Linode and he provided a great walkthough with helpful
screenshots, as well as brief notes about the handful of differences compared
with EC2.  Chris also wrote about the issue he had with clean urls (i.e
serving <code>/about/index.html</code> when a user visits <code>/about/</code>) — he describes the
things he tried out until he was finally able to fix it.  </p>

<p>Phil focused on getting unikernels running on a cubieboards, which are ARM
based development boards — similar to the Raspberry Pi. He starts by taking
Mirage’s pre-built <a href="http://blobs.openmirage.org">Cubieboard images</a> — which makes it easy to
get Xen and an OCaml environment set up on the board — and getting this
installed on the Cubieboard.  He also noted the issues he came across along
with the simple tweaks he made to fix them and finally serves a Mirage hello
world page.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="more-than-just-static-sites">More than just static sites</h3>

<p>Static sites have become the new ‘hello world’ app. They’re simple to manage,
low-risk and provide lots of opportunities to experience something new.  These
aspects make them ideal for discovering the benefits (and trade offs) of the
unikernel approach and I look forward to seeing what variations people come up
with — For instance, there aren’t any public instructions for deploying to
Rackspace so it would be great to read about someone’s experiences there.
However, there are also many other applications that also fit the above
criteria of simplicity, low risk and plentiful learning opportunities. </p>

<p>Thomas Leonard decided to create a unikernel for a simple REST service for
queuing package uploads for 0install.  His post takes you from the very
beginning, with a simple hello world program running on Xen, all the way
through to creating his REST service. Along the way there a lots of code
snippets and explanations of the libraries being used and what they’re doing.
This is a great use-case for unikernels and there are a lot of interesting
things to take from this post, for example the ease with which Thomas was able
to find and fix bugs using regular tools. There’s also lots of information on
performance testing and optimising of the unikernel, which he covers in a
follow-up post, and he even built tools to visualise the traces. </p>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there’s much more activity out there than described in this post as
people continually propose ideas on the <a href="http://lists.xenproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mirageos-devel">Mirage mailing list</a> — both
for things they would like to try out and issues they came up against. In my
<a href="http://nymote.org/blog/2014/from-jekyll-site-to-unikernel/">last post</a>, I pointed out that the workflow is applicable to any
type of unikernel and as Thomas showed, with bit of effort it’s already
possible to create useful, real-world services using the many libraries that
already exist. There’s also a lot of scaffolding in the <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton">mirage-skeleton</a>
repo that you can build on which makes it even easier to get involved.  If you
want to dive deeper into the libraries and perhaps learn OCaml, there are lots
of <a href="http://ocaml.org/learn/books.html">resources online</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Pioneer-Projects">projects</a> to get involved with too.</p>

<p>Now is a great time to try building a unikernel for yourself and as you can
see from the posts above, shared experiences help other people progress
further and branch out into new areas. When you’ve had a chance to try
something out please do share your experiences online! </p>

<p>The projects around the OCaml.org domain name are becoming more established
and it’s time to think about how they’re organised. 2014 saw a <em>lot</em> of
activity, which built on the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/news/index.html#OnlineatOCamlorg">successes from 2013</a>.
Some of the main things that stand out to me are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>More <a href="http://ocaml.org/contributors.html">volunteers</a> contributing to the public website with
translations, bug fixes and content updates, as well as many new visitors —
for example, the new page on <a href="http://ocaml.org/learn/teaching-ocaml.html">teaching OCaml</a> received over 5k
visits alone. The increasing contributions are a result of the earlier work on
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/announcing-new-ocamlorg/">re-engineering the site</a> and there are many ways to get involved
so please do <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/labels/contribute%21">contribute</a>!</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/web/opampkg-2015-01-08.png" /></a></p>

<ul>
  <li>The relentless improvements and growth of OPAM, both in terms of the
repository — with over 1000 additional packages and several
<a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/opam-devel/2014-October/000781.html">new repo maintainers</a> — and also improved workflows (e.g the new
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-1-2-pin/">pin functionality</a>). 
The OPAM site and package list also moved to the ocaml.org domain, becoming
the substrate for the OCaml Platform efforts. This began with the work towards
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-1-2-0-beta4/">OPAM 1.2</a> and there is much more to come (including closer
integration in terms of styling). Join the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/platform">Platform list</a> to
keep up to date.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Much more activity on the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org">mailing lists</a> in general and user groups
requesting to have lists made (e.g the <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/teaching">teaching list</a>). If anyone
has a need for a new list, just ask on the
<a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure">infrastructure list</a>!</li>
</ul>

<p>There is other work besides those I’ve mentioned and I think by any measure,
all the projects have been quite successful. As the community continues to
develop, it’s important to clarify how things currently work to improve the
level of transparency and make it easier for newcomers to get involved.</p>

<h3 id="factors-for-a-governance-framework">Factors for a governance framework</h3>

<p>For the last couple of months, I’ve been looking over how larger projects
manage themselves and the governance documents that are available. My aim has
been to put such a document together for the OCaml.org domain without
introducing burdensome processes.  There are number of things that stood out
to me during this process, which have guided the approach I’m taking.</p>

<p>My considerations for an OCaml.org governance document:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A governance document is not <em>necessary</em> for success but it’s valuable to
demonstrate a commitment to a <strong>stable decision-making process</strong>.  There are
many projects that progress perfectly well without any documented processes
and indeed the work around OCaml.org so far is a good example of this (as well
as OCaml itself).  However, for projects to achieve a scale greater than the
initial teams, it’s a significant benefit to encode in writing how things work
(NB: please note that I didn’t define the <em>type</em> of decision-making process -
merely that it’s a stable one).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It must <strong>clarify its scope</strong> so that there is no confusion about what the
document covers. In the case of OCaml.org, it needs to be clear that the
governance covers the domain itself, rather than referring to the website. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should <strong>document the reality</strong>, rather than represent an aspirational
goal or what people <em>believe</em> a governance structure should look like.  It’s
very tempting to think of an idealised structure without recognising that
behaviours and norms have <em>already</em> been established. Sometimes this will be
vague and poorly defined but that might simply indicate areas that the
community hasn’t encountered yet (e.g it’s uncommon for any new project to
seriously think about dispute resolution processes until they have to).  In
this sense, the initial version of a governance document should simply be a
written description of how things currently stand, rather than a means to
adjust that behaviour.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be <strong>simple and self-contained</strong>, so that anyone can understand
the intent quickly without recourse to other documents.  It may be tempting to
consider every edge-case or try to resolve every likely ambiguity but this
just leads to large, legal documents.  This approach may well be necessary
once projects have reached a certain scale but to implement it sooner would be
a case of premature optimisation — not to mention that very few people would 
read and remember such a document.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s a <strong>living document</strong>. If the community decides that it would prefer a
new arrangement, then the document conveniently provides a stable starting
point from which to iterate. Indeed, it <em>should</em> adapt along with the project
that it governs. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With the above points in mind, I’ve been putting together a draft governance
framework to cover how the OCaml.org domain name is managed.  It’s been a
quiet work-in-progress for some time and I’ll be getting in touch with
maintainers of specific projects soon.  Once I’ve had a round of reviews, I’ll
be sharing it more widely and posting it here!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m speaking to the <a href="http://joinef.com">Entrepreneur First</a> cohort this morning about the future of resilient, distributed systems and what I&#8217;m working on to get us there.  Firstly, I&#8217;m describing the kinds of solutions we have today, the great things they offer developers as well as the issues they create. This leads into the new toolstack we&#8217;re creating, called the MISO stack, and the benefits and trade-offs.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m spending more time talking about <a href="http://openmirage.org">Mirage OS</a> &#8211; the &#8216;M&#8217; in the MISO stack &#8211; because the workflow we&#8217;ve developed here underpins how we build, deploy and maintain such applications at scale. As an example of how things can work, I point at my earlier post on how to go from <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/from-jekyll-to-unikernel-in-fifty-lines">jekyll to unikernel</a>.  This uses TravisCI to do all the hard work and all the relevant artefacts, including the final VM, can be version-controlled through Git. I actually deployed this post while the audience was watching, so that I could point at <a href="http://travisci.org/amirmc/amirmc.github.com">the build logs</a>.</p>

<p>One of the use cases for our toolstack is to make it possible for individuals to create and maintain their own piece of the cloud, a project called <a href="http://nymote.org">Nymote</a>, which will also make it possible to run the <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/working-on-the-internet-of-my-things/">Internet of <em>my</em> Things</a> &#8211; which itself is related to another things I&#8217;m working on, such the <a href="http://hubofallthings.com">Hub of All Things - HAT</a> and the <a href="http://usercentricnetworking.eu">User Centric Networking</a> projects.</p>

<p>This is an exciting summer for all the tools we&#8217;re putting together, since we&#8217;ve recently <a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/announcing-mirage-20-release">announced Mirage OS v2.0</a>, which now works on ARM, are going full steam ahead with <a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/introducing-irmin">Irmin</a> and working hard on improvements to the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/tasks/platform.html">OCaml ecosystem</a>. It&#8217;s a great time to explore these projects, learn a new language and build awesome stuff.</p>

<p class="footnote">[This story was also a
    <a href="http://seedcamp.com/seedhack-5-0/">guest post</a>
    on the <a href="http://seedcamp.com">Seedcamp</a> blog.]</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I took part in <a href="http://seedhack.com">Seedhack 5.0</a>, on the theme
of life-logging. My team were overall winners with Clarity, our calendar
assistant app. This post captures my experiences of what happened over the
weekend, the process of how we built the app and the main things I learned.
You’ll find out what Clarity is at the end – just like we did.</p>

<h3 id="meeting-people-and-pitches-on-friday">Meeting people and pitches on Friday</h3>

<p>The weekend began with some information on the APIs available to us, which
was followed by pizza and mingling with everyone. I spoke to a few people
about what they were working on and the technologies they were used to. It
was good to find a mixture of experience and I was specifically looking for
folks with an interest in functional programming – that’s how I first met
Vlad over Twitter. </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/vla_ve/statuses/485083697172185088"><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-1.jpg" alt="Tweets with Vlad" /></a></p>

<p>After pizza, those people with ideas, even if not fully formed, were invited
to share them with the room. I came in to Seedhack with specific thoughts on
the kind of things I wanted to work on so I spoke about one of those.  </p>

<h3 id="pitching-personal-clouds">Pitching Personal Clouds</h3>

<p>I described the problem of silos, poor interoperability and how all the
life-logging data should really be owned by the user. That would allow third
parties to request access and provide way more value to users, while
maintaining privacy and security. Building a centralised service makes a lot
of sense in the first instance but what’s more disruptive than eschewing the
current model of yet-another-silo and putting the user in control? If that
sounds familiar, it’s because I’m trying to solve these problems already.  </p>

<p>I’m working on a open source toolstack for building distributed systems that
I call the MISO stack, which is analogous to the LAMP stack of old but
is based on <a href="http://openmirage.org">Mirage OS</a>.  With this stack, I’m putting together a
system to help people create and run their own little piece of the cloud
– <a href="http://nymote.org">Nymote</a>. The <a href="http://nymote.org/blog/2013/introducing-nymote/">introductory post</a> and my post on
‘<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/working-on-the-internet-of-my-things/">The Internet of <em>my</em> Things</a>’ has more detail on why I’m working
on this. </p>

<p>For systems like this to be viable, we must be willing to trust them with
the core applications of Email, Contacts and Calendar. Without advanced and
robust options for running these, it’s unlikely that anyone (including me)
would want to switch away from the current providers. Of these three
applications, I decided to talk about the contact management solution, since
I happen to have wireframes and thought it might be simpler to implement
something over the weekend. </p>

<!--
Some readers may not be convinced but I like to recall a 1977 quote by Ken
Olsen, Cofounder and CEO of Digital Equipment Corp., who said *"[There is no
reason for any individual to have a computer in his home][olsen]."* We now
carry computers in our pockets (see footnote), so it's perfectly reasonable
to me that we'll all have our own clouds one day.
-->

<p>There was quite a bit of interest in the overall concept but what really
piqued my curiosity was that someone else presented some thoughts around
Calendars and analytics. After a brief chat, we decided to join forces and
tackle the problems of Calendar management. The team had a great mix of
experience from product to design and several of them had worked together
before.</p>

<h3 id="thick-fog-and-ambiguity-on-friday-evening">Thick fog and ambiguity on Friday evening</h3>

<p>We had all decided to work together and we knew it would be on the problem
of calendar management and analytics. We were fired up but it quickly became
obvious that was <em>all</em> we knew.</p>

<p>The next four to five <em>hours</em> were spent discussing the rough shape of what
we were going to build, what specific problem we thought we were solving and
whether there were enough people with such a problem to care. </p>

<p>We had a look at each other’s calendars and talked about how we each use
them and the things we like and dislike about them. For example, I have
around nine calendars and I curate them carefully, adding contextual
information and sometimes even correcting old events to reflect what
happened. We even bounced around the idea of the contact management app
several times as well as a few other ideas that came up during the
discussions. </p>

<p>These conversations took a while and it seemed like we were going around in
circles. Despite this, it didn’t feel particularly frustrating. I realised
that the same sticking point was coming up repeatedly because we were
forcing ourselves to imagine a prototypical customer and the problems <em>they</em>
might have. This was never going to work since we wouldn’t have time to go
and find such people and do basic customer development. Far better to
constrain the problem to something <em>we</em> experience so that we can look to
ourselves for initial customer feedback.  Once we did this, things seemed to
go a little faster and taking breaks for food helped us keep our energy up.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/inthecompanyof/status/485463322020839424"><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-2.jpg" alt="Mani grabbing falafel for dinner" /></a></p>

<p>There were a few occasions where I looked around the room and saw other
teams with their heads down, headphones in, and bashing away at keyboards
– we hadn’t even figured out what we were doing yet.
Despite this, it was a great exercise because it allowed all of us to get a
feel for what aspects each of us cared about most and it helped us form some
kind of shared language for the product. </p>

<p>The only outcome from this first evening was an outline but it was an
important one. It distilled what we what we were going to work on and the
components of it. We did this so we’d have a clear starting point the next
morning and could get going quickly.  Here’s a paraphrased version of what
we sent ourselves. </p>

<p>```text
Smart Calendar App.</p>

<p>We are collecting data from mobile and from desktop. 
- Mobile includes:
  - Call logs
  - Location (if we can)
  - Messages
  - What application is being used and when
- Desktop includes:
  - What application is active and timestamps of it
  - Location?
  - Git Logs … ?
  - Taking logs of their existing calendars.</p>

<p>Working out what people are doing.
- Extrapolating info from active application (e.g browser page)</p>

<p>Present info back via calendar UI
- Need to turn all this information into webcal events</p>

<p>Useful info we want
- Time spent travelling (how much?)
- Time in meetings 
- Time on phone
- Who the meetings/calls were with
- Relevant docs/emails these are linked with
- Use labels
```</p>

<p>Then it was time for some late night snacks.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nicolagreco/status/485201493633826818"><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-3.jpg" alt="Midnight snacks" /></a></p>

<p>With one challenge out of the way, the next one was finding somewhere to
sleep for a few hours (Campus was closing from 01:30). I had nothing planned
but luckily for me, a couple of team members had booked a hotel room for the
night. The minor complication was that we had to first find the hotel and
then somehow get six people into a room meant for two – without the night
manager kicking us out. That’s a whole other story, but it suffices to say
that James Bond has nothing to worry about.</p>

<h3 id="rays-of-light-and-clearing-haze-on-saturday">Rays of light and clearing haze on Saturday</h3>

<p>After some card games and a few hours of sleep, we headed back to Campus and
during this walk, we came up with ‘Clarity’ as the name of the application. </p>

<p>Once we arrived, development began. River volunteered his digital
assets to the cause (i.e. his whole Google life). Mani worked on the Android
app, Vlad on a Chrome extension with Joao pulling in the Google Apps data as
well as combining it with data from the various platform apps. Jeremy worked
on the front-end of the site, while River and I began wireframing the UI and
user flow through the site. </p>

<p>Once the development was well underway, I realised how superfluous ‘the
business guys’ can be. It would have been easy to simply sit there and let
everyone get on with it but there were other things River and I did while
developers were writing code.</p>

<p><em>Wireframing</em> - We spent time thinking about what a user would actually see
and engage with once they visited the Clarity site. We made a lot of
sketches on paper and this was helpful because communication with the team
was smoother with something to guide the discussion. It also helped to
inform the design work and gave River and I something to show to potential
users. </p>

<p><em>Talk to people</em> - aka early customer development. We already knew that we
were our own customers but it was useful to talk to other people for two
reasons. Firstly, to get an idea of how they use their calendars and whether
they have similar problems to us and secondly, to see what thoughts we
prompt when we describe our solution (or show our wireframes). This led to
useful information on how we should refine the product and and position
ourselves against perceived competition.</p>

<p><em>Refine the product</em> - Going through the wireframing and talking to people
helped us come up with several new ideas for how to display the data back to
users. Some of these seemed great at the time, but after showing some paper
sketches to other people, we realised customers didn’t care about certain
things, so we discarded them. Even though Jeremy had already done the work of
putting together the UI for them (sorry, Jeremy!).</p>

<p><em>Examine the competition</em> - After we described what we were working on. A
few people mentioned potential competitors and asked how we were different.
Initially, we didn’t know much about these companies but it was something we
could explore while development was underway and consider our positioning.</p>

<p><em>Remind people to regroup</em> - Every few hours, we would make sure everyone
caught up with each other.  We would check that things were going well, share
what we’d learned from talking to people and discuss any technical problems
and possible workarounds – including changing the scope of the product. The
discussions we’d had on Friday meant that we spent less time debating when
these questions came up during the weekend.</p>

<p><em>Work on the pitch</em> - River and I began working on the pitch from just after
Saturday lunchtime and kept building on it until Sunday afternoon. This,
combined with showing our sketches to people, made it much easier to think
about the story we wanted to tell the audience. In turn, that made it easier
to think about the product development that <em>had</em> to be completed by Sunday.
Especially in terms of a kick-ass demo.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mindeedly/status/485502064437780480"><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-4.jpg" alt="Popcorn and candyfloss" /></a></p>

<h3 id="bright-sunshine-and-achieving-clarity-on-sunday-afternoon">Bright sunshine and achieving Clarity on Sunday afternoon</h3>

<p>Development carried on through the night and we took a break to watch some
sports via River’s laptop – at this point Clarity was actually logging this
and other events.
The next morning, we reiterated what we needed to
get done for the demo and I was pretty ruthless about practising the pitch.
River and I practised endlessly while everyone else made sure the the
technical pieces were working smoothly. We had a lot of moving parts and
making sure they were glued together seamlessly was important.
At this point, we knew what Clarity was and how to tell its story.</p>

<h3 id="introducing-clarity">Introducing Clarity</h3>

<p>We all have calendars and we put a lot of time and effort into managing them
but get very little back. A simple glance at your calendar for the past
month will show you a sea of information with no idea where your time was
actually spent. We believe your calendar should be working harder for you.
Your calendar should give you clarity. </p>

<p><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-5.jpg" alt="Calendar" /></p>

<p>Over the course of the weekend, we built tools that can go through your
calendar and understand the events you’re involved in and tie them back to
the relevant emails, documents and people.  With a suite of software that
spans across your GDrive, Chrome and Android, we’re able to combine your
calendars with rich, contextual information so you can really understand
what your time is being spent on.</p>

<p><a href="http://clarityapp.me"><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/seedhack2014/seedhack2014-6.jpg" alt="Clarity summary view" /></a></p>

<p>We built this system and plugged it into River’s digital life.
If we take a look at River’s summary for the last month, we see that he’s
spent around 32 hours in meetings in London last month, despite living in
Sheffield. We can also see that he’s spent an hour on the phone with someone
called Lee, but that all of them were short calls. The next person also
totalled an hour on the phone but only across 3 calls.  Already, River has
learned something about the the people he interacts with most and how. We
can also drill down further and see all this activity presented in a
calendar view, except this now represents where his time <em>did</em> go, rather
than where he thought it went. For example, he’s most active via text
message between 4pm and 5pm during the week, and we can see that he spent
a few hours watching sports last night.</p>

<p>Clarity can do much more than provide an accurate retrospective view of your
time. Since it interacts with all the important components of your life,
like your phone and laptop, it can even perform helpful actions for you.
For example, say I have a meeting set up with River but I want to reschedule
it. I simply send a text to him as I normally would, suggesting that we move
it to another day. Clarity can pick up that message and is smart enough to
understand its intent, find the relevant calendar event and <em>reschedule
it automatically</em>. River doesn’t have to lift a finger and his diary is
always up to date. It’s easy to imagine a future where we might never have
to add or edit events ourselves. </p>

<p>Clarity is a smart calendar assistant that understands the context around
you, provides you with insight into your life and helps you seamlessly
organise your future. You can find out more at

<p>After the pitches, we met a lot of people who had the same problems as we
did with calendar management. Several offered to be beta testers. After
waiting for the judges, prizes were announced and Clarity was declared the
overall winner of Seedhack 5.0!</p>

<h3 id="things-i-learned">Things I learned</h3>

<p>Looking back, there were a lot of things we did which I think
helped us get to the winning slot, so I thought I’d summarise them here.</p>

<p><strong>Think first</strong> - We spent time up front to <em>define</em> what we were
going to work on. I thought this step was crucial as it meant we all
understood the shape of the problem but also the areas that each of us were
interested in.  That helped later in the weekend as we could refer back to
things we discussed on Friday.</p>

<p><strong>Move fast</strong> - Once we did figure out what we were doing, then it was a
matter of building the software to gather and crunch the data. A lot of this
was done in parallel as Jeremy worked on the front-end UI while Mani, Joao
and Vlad took care of the data aggregation, analytics and platform products.
Don’t be afraid to throw away ideas if you find that they don’t work for
people and remember it’s a <em>hackathon</em> (i.e gruesome hacks are the norm).</p>

<p><strong>Remember the demo</strong> - At some point you’re going to be forced to stand up
and talk about what you’ve done. We started thinking about this from
Saturday lunchtime and sketched out the slides and the elements of the app
we wanted to show. This helped inform the UI and technology that we were
building and the pitch never felt like it was rushed.</p>

<p><strong>Practice, practice, practice</strong> - we were told we’d have 3 minutes to
pitch/demo and maybe a few additional questions. I made sure River and I
practised <em>repeatedly</em> to get our time down to 3mins and ensure we getting
across everything we wanted to.  The important thing with such a
short amount of time, is that we were forced to <em>cut</em> things out as well as
ensure we emphasised the main points. It was a ruthless exercise in saying
‘no’. During the actual pitches, we realised everyone was taking longer
(without repercussions), so I added an extra 30 seconds to cover the
potential market sizes and business models.</p>

<p><strong>Leave artefacts</strong> - After the pitches, we knew that we had to take the
site down. It was built at high speed and in a way that ended up exposing
someone’s data to the internet at large (thanks, River!). It might have
been somewhat easier to build something using faked data that we could
happily share the URL to and leave online.  On the other hand, our demo
would not have been half as compelling if we weren’t running it real-time
on live data.</p>

<h3 id="looking-to-the-future">Looking to the future</h3>

<p>This is a product we all want to use and the team is interested in taking
this forward. There are a lot of things to think about and many
things we would build differently so we’re discussing the next steps. For
example, there are likely ways to empower the end-users to control their
data and give them more flexibility, even though the work at the hackathon
was already quite impressive. Given how well Seedhack went, you might even
see us at <a href="http://seedcamp.com/events/seedcamp-week-london/">Seedcamp Week</a> later in the year. If you think this is
something you’d like to work on with us,

<p>To wrap things up, here’s a victory selfie!</p>

<p class="footnote">**Footnote: It's worth reading the
<a href="http://www.snopes.com/quotes/kenolsen.asp">linked article</a> as
the quote is usually taken out of context -- did you notice that I'm guilty
of that too? :). Ken actually <strong>did</strong> understand the value of
PCs and having them at home. What he was disputing was that we would have
computers everywhere that would be running our lives. There's delicious
irony here because that is <strong>exactly</strong> the promise of the
Internet of Things and 'Big Data'. Systems that know us better than we know
ourselves.</p>
