        <h2><a class="post-title" href="/writing-planet-in-pure-ocaml">Writing Planet in pure OCaml</a></h2>
        <p>I've been learning OCaml for some time now but not really had a problem that
I wanted to solve. As such, my progress has been rather slow and sporadic
and I only make time for exercises when I'm travelling. In order to focus my
learning, I have to identify and tackle something specific. That's usually
the best way to advance and I recently found something I can work on.</p>

<p>As I've been trying to write more blog posts, I want to be able to keep as
much content on my own site as possible and syndicate my posts out to other
sites I run. Put simply, I want to be able to take multiple feeds from
different sources and merge them into one feed, which will be served from
some other site. In addition, I also want to render that feed as HTML on a
webpage. All of this has to remain within the OCaml toolchain so it can be
used as part of <a href="http://openmirage.org/">Mirage</a> (i.e. I can use it when
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/from-jekyll-to-unikernel-in-fifty-lines">building unikernels</a>).</p>

<p>What I'm describing might sound familiar and there's a well-known tool that
does this called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)">Planet</a>. It's a 'river of news' feed reader, which
aggregates feeds and can display posts on webpages and you can find the
<a href="http://www.planetplanet.org">original Planet</a> and it's successor <a href="http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/docs/index.html">Venus</a>, both written in Python.
However, Venus seems to be unmaintained as there are a number of
<a href="https://github.com/rubys/venus/issues">unresolved issues and pull requests</a>, which have been
languishing for quite some time with no discussion. There does appear to be
a more active Ruby implementation called <a href="http://feedreader.github.io/">Pluto</a>, with recent commits and
no reported issues.</p>

<!-- 
    \[Rant: Frankly, the naming of these versions leaves a lot to be desired.
    When you know exactly what you're supposed to Google for you're fine, but
    until then you're just on a random-walk through space websites. I'm
    lucky I managed to get to the Wikipedia page.\] 
-->


<h3>Benefits of a Planet in pure OCaml</h3>

<p>Although I could use the one of the above options, it would be much more
useful to keep everything within the OCaml ecosystem.  This way I can make
the best use of the <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2566628">unikernel approach</a> with Mirage (i.e lean,
single-purpose appliances). Obviously, the existing options don't lend
themselves to this approach and there are <a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1349&amp;group_id=1&amp;atid=101">known bugs</a> as a lot has
changed on the web since Planet Venus (e.g the adoption of HTML5).
Having said that, I can learn a lot from the existing implementations and
I'm glad I'm not embarking into completely uncharted territory.</p>

<p>In addition, the OCaml version doesn't need to (and <em>shouldn't</em>) be written
as one monolithic library.  Instead, pulling together a collection of
smaller, reusable libraries that present clear interfaces to each other
would make things much more maintainable. This would bring substantially
greater benefits to everyone and <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/">OPAM</a> can manage the dependencies.</p>

<!--
    OPAM makes managing dependencies easy so having a number of single-
    purpose libraries is A Good Thing and costs almost nothing.  This 
    approach has already worked well with examples like an [IP address 
    library][ipaddr] and the [OCaml markdown library][OMD], which can be 
    used by multiple projects.
-->


<h3>Breaking down the problem</h3>

<p>The first cut is somewhat straightforward as we have a piece that deals with
the consumption and manipulation of feeds and another that takes the result
and emits HTML. This is also how the original Planet is put together, with a
library called <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/feedparser/">feedparser</a> and another for templating pages.</p>

<p>For the feed-parsing aspect, I can break it down further by considering Atom
and RSS feeds separately and then even further by thinking about how to (1)
consume such feeds and (2) output them. Then there is the HTML component,
where it may be necessary to consider existing representations of HTML. These
are not new ideas and since I'm claiming that individual pieces might be
useful then it's worth finding out which ones are already available.</p>

<h4>Existing components</h4>

<p>The easiest way to find existing libraries is via the
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/packages">OPAM package list</a>. Some quick searches for <code>RSS</code>, <code>XML</code>, <code>HTML</code>
and <code>net</code> bring up a lot of packages. The most relevant of these seem to be
<a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/xmlm/xmlm.1.2.0/">xmlm</a>, <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/ocamlrss/ocamlrss.2.2.2/">ocamlrss</a>, <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/cow/cow.0.9.1/">cow</a> and maybe <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/xmldiff/xmldiff.0.1/">xmldiff</a>. I noticed that
nothing appears, when searching for <code>Atom</code>, but I do know that <code>cow</code> has an
Atom module for creating feeds. In terms of turning feeds into pages and
HTML, I'm aware of <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/blob/master/script/rss2html.ml">rss2html</a> used on the <a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml</a> website and parts of
<a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/ocamlnet/ocamlnet.3.7.3/">ocamlnet</a> that may be relevant (e.g <code>nethtml</code> and <code>netstring</code>) as well as
<code>cow</code>.  There is likely to be other code I'm missing but this is useful as a
first pass.</p>

<p>Overall, a number of components are already out there but it's not obvious
if they're compatible (e.g html) and there are still gaps (e.g atom). Since
I also want to minimise dependencies, I'll try and use whatever works but
may ultimately have to roll my own. Either way, I can learn from what
already exists. Perhaps I'm being overconfident but if I can break things
down sensibly and keep the scope constrained then this should be an
achievable project.</p>

<h3>The first (baby) steps - an Atom parser</h3>

<p>As this is an exercise for me to learn OCaml by solving a problem, I need to
break it down into bite-size pieces and take each one at a time. Practically
speaking, this means limiting the scope to be as narrow as possible while
still producing a useful result <em>for me</em>.  That last part is important as I
have specific needs and it's likely that the first thing I make won't be
particularly interesting for many others.</p>

<p>For my specific use-case, I'm only interested in dealing with Atom feeds as
that's what I use on my site and others I'm involved with. Initial feedback
is that creating an Atom parser will be the bulk of the work and I should
start by defining the types. To keep this manageable, I'm only going to deal
with my own feeds instead of attempting a fully compliant parser (in other
words, I'll only consider the subset of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">RFC4287</a> that's relevant to me).
Once I can parse, merge and write such feeds I should be able to iterate
from there.</p>

<p>To make my requirements more concrete:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only consider <em>my own</em> Atom feeds for now</li>
<li>Initially, be able to parse and emit just one Atom feed</li>
<li>Then be able to merge 2+ feeds, specifically:

<ul>
<li>Use tag-based feeds from my personal site as starting points</li>
<li>Be able to de-dupe content</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No database or storage (construct it afresh every time)</li>
<li>Minimise library dependencies</li>
</ul>


<!-- 
    Perhaps these requirements are already too much and I may decide to dial
    it down even further (e.g just figure out how to consume *one* feed),
    but I won't really know until I get started. For example, I can imagine
    that I'll need one bunch of code to deal with Atom feeds and then
    perhaps I can make another (feedparser), that depends on it and others
    to deal with general feeds.
-->


<h4>Timeframes and workflow</h4>

<p>I've honestly no idea how long this might take and I'm treating it as a
side-project. I know there are many people out there who could produce a
working version of everything in a week or two but I'm not one of them (yet).
There are also <em>a lot</em> of ancillary things I need to learn on the way, like
packaging, improving my knowledge of Git and dealing with build systems. If
I had to put a vague time frame on this, I'd be thinking in months rather
than weeks.  It might even be the case that others start work on parts of
this and ship things sooner but that's great as I'll probably be able to use
whatever they create and move further along the chain.</p>

<p>In terms of workflow, everything will be done in the open, warts and all, and
I expect to make embarrassing mistakes as I go. You can follow along on my
freshly created <a href="https://github.com/amirmc/ocamlatom">OCaml Atom</a> repo, and I'll be using the issue tracker as
the main way of dealing with bugs and features. Let the fun begin.</p>

        <h2><a class="post-title" href="/iot-brave-new-world-or-evolved-m2m">IoT - Brave New World or Simply evolved M2M?</a></h2>
        <p>I was at an <a href="http://www.cambridgewireless.co.uk/events/article/default.aspx?objid=43697">event</a> run by Cambridge Wireless today on the Internet of
Things.  These are my notes. Although I've named people, I'm paraphrasing a
lot so best not to treat anything you read here as a direct quote.</p>

<p>There were a few audience polls conducted using little keypads they handed
out. There were only 30-ish keypads so it's not necessarily indicative of
how the whole room felt.  I took some hasty pics of a few of the slides
(mainly the poll results) so apologies for the poor quality.</p>

<h3>"The Enterprise and the Internet of Things - Evolution or Revolution?"</h3>

<p><em>John Hicklin, Principal Consultant | Commercial Enterprise Markets, CGI UK</em></p>

<p>Nowadays, you can walk into the C-suite and start a discussion about the IoT.
They may not know what they're talking about but someone's told them they
need to be thinking about it.  But what is IoT?</p>

<p>One of the problems in industry you go to your Director and you explain this
new tech and all the awesome things you can do with it and he asks the
dreaded question, "So what?"  Example of the Connected Toothbrush. With a
connected toothbrush you can automatically have a remote relationship with
your dentist.  But he already drives a BMW and it's not clear how he
benefits from that.  He wants you in the office where, every time you open
your mouth, he sees new business development opportunities.  For the moment,
he neither needs nor wants a remote relationship with you. Leads to the
question about who's going to sign up for the business case.</p>

<p>Number of key areas that need to be addressed (paraphrased):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Crack open the Data</strong>: We are awash with data but don't know how to use
it. Problem with clients is that they really buy into the vision but they
have a lot of legacy systems (green screens!) which already run things.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identifying value</strong>(?): Volume is not a sign of success.  Need to know
where the value is, which means understanding it. e.g is Enron. Thousands of
documents, accountants all over the place with tons of data. It took a small
team of a few researchers doing a case study that discovered no tax had ever
been paid.  They got to the right data and asked the right questions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Connectivity</strong>(?): M2M has grown in a silo'd manner where a device takes
data and sends it to one place.  This needs to open up more and give access
to other areas of business.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Business operations</strong>: People matter too. Process changes, systems that
allow real-time decisions, empowering individuals.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, IoT is an enabler for a number of wider trends. IoT can improve
operational efficiency <strong>and</strong> enhance customer experience.  Normally these
are in conflict with each-other. However, if we just get into a tech-fest,
then we might just end up with a large number of failures as we've seen with
'Big Data'</p>

<h3>"Overcoming the Internet of Things Connectivity Challenge"</h3>

<p><em>David Dunn, Software Engineer, Electric Imp</em></p>

<p>Electric Imp aims to help people in Product Development in the IoT space,
namely with the connectivity problem.  The name 'IMP' came from 'Internet
Messaging Processor'. Name is also from Terry Pratchett who's stories had
devices that contained an imp which did the work :)</p>

<p>Building connected devices is difficult. Have to be secure, easy to set up.
There are many choices for connectivity, problems with managing the code on
the devices.  Electric Imp picked wifi and decided to do it well.  This
satisfies a lot of markets but not all.</p>

<p>Side story of the <a href="http://www.proofpoint.com/threatinsight/posts/your-fridge-is-full-of-spam-part-ll-details.php">hacked fridge sending spam emails</a>.</p>

<p>Things run through Electric Imp system and they manage the security. It's
security as a service.  Electric Imp manages deployment of your code too so
developers can just push code and it will end up on all their devices.</p>

<p>Simplicity comes from one-step setup.  It's optical and uses a smartphone
and flashes the screen, which sends the wifi SSID and credentials to the
device (via a sensor). Customer code runs within a VM on top of with custom
OS (impOS) taking care of I/O (TLS-encrypted wifi connection to service).</p>

<p>Difficult to debug devices in the field so cloud based- service helps with
that. They do embedded stuff on the device and cloud stuff in the cloud.
There's another VM in the cloud that's paired with the VM on the device.
Heavy lifting can happens elsewhere so no need to parse JSON on the device
itself.</p>

<p>Q - How do you deal with identity of units?<br/>
A - Imps have unique serials and the devices they're plugged into are also unique (missed how).</p>

<h3>"Real-life experiences from rolling out M2M networks and how we can learn from these in the shift to IoT"</h3>

<p><em>Jon Lewis, Chief Innovation Officer, Plextek Consulting</em></p>

<p>Plextek was working in this field when it was called 'telemetry'.  One of
the earliest things they worked on was 'Lojack' (car tracking). Things then
shifted to 'smart cities' and now people talk about 'IoT' and want consumer
devices with consumer volumes.</p>

<p>2014 has got to be year of IoT. However, still some way from business cases
as it's too expensive to simply track your cat (approx £100 set up fee and
then around £30 pcm).</p>

<p>Deployment often costs more than then the sensor devices. c.f street
lighting systems.  Choice of radio system is critical.  Projects in
UK/Europe are about incremental cost savings with pay-back in less than 5yrs.
In industrialising countries, there is new build which is easier then
retrofit.  Urbanisation creates strain and demand. Local issues relate to
the Spectrum issues and local regulations (e.g mandate to use govt
encryption streams).  Data privacy is also concern as we don't know who
holds the monkey. That's made even more difficult when you go abroad.  Local
politics also matters.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Big opportunity in B2C: but need consolidation in B2B markets to get
necessary economies of scale</li>
<li>Big B2B opportunity in developing countries: but is tough and needs local
partners</li>
<li>Application developers need common platforms: to lower R&amp;D costs and
enable access to global markets</li>
<li>Whole value chain needs to work: building an ecosystem that connects
application developers to markets is key to achieving scale</li>
</ul>


<h3>"The role of LTE in M2M"</h3>

<p><em>Georg Steimel, Head of M2M Solutions, Huawei</em></p>

<p>About Huawei
- Three businesses: Carrier network, Consumer business, Enterprise business
- Revenues of $39Bn, No2. Telecom solution provider, 150k+ employees
worldwide</p>

<p>Georg is in Consumer branch for Europe.  Huawei wants to be top M2M module
vendor in the coming years.  They're operator and system integrator agnostic.</p>

<p>Tech evolution brings new opportunities. Mobile data traffic needs, Network
upgrading etc. Ave user expected to generated 1G data traffic per month
(currently 63MB today) and there are predicted to be 50Bn+ devices.
Examples of users are highly varied including monitoring of pregnant cows.</p>

<p>Challenges for mass rollout are a scattered market requiring complex
solutions.  Alignment of all parties in one adequate business model is quite
tricky, esp when it comes to customer ownership. Should consider the value
chain.</p>

<p>Complex business model:</p>

<ul>
<li>From sales to service</li>
<li>Many stakeholders

<ul>
<li>Who pays, how much, to whom, for what service, for what benefits?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Individual benefit must exceed cost

<ul>
<li>Realistic pricing</li>
<li>Appropriate effort</li>
<li>Total benefit, direct vs indirect TCO</li>
<li>Sustainability</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Amount of data generated is also going to be huge.  Smart meters in German
households could send over 4TB per day, which is a huge strain for mobile
networks.</p>

<p>LTE advantage for M2M is obviously bandwidth but that's only relevant to a
few verticals (signage, routers, and in-car entertainment). Low latency is
more important for industrial alarms and medical devices.</p>

<h3>"Using networked visualisation for better decision making"</h3>

<p><em>Fredrik Sjostedt, Vice President | Corporate Marketing, Barco Ltd</em></p>

<p>Barco does a lot of visualising information. Displays for radiographers,
stuff in cinema screens, screens in flight simulators and a lot more.</p>

<p>Need to take in data from sensors, display relevant information and allow
operators to make SMART decisions.  e.g number of CCTV cameras in London -
who's looking at them? Real 'Big Data' step is at the operator level.</p>

<p>Important to use standards, rather than proprietary systems.</p>

<p>Q - In transport visualisation do you have low enough latency to get
real-time info?<br/>
A- Yes, e.g on a route in Brazil near Sao Palo it's closed dues to fog.
Real-time info important for understanding the whole route.</p>

<h3>"Regulatory backdrop on IP and standards issues for the M2M eco-system"</h3>

<p><em>Justin Hill, Co-Head of the Patent Prosecution Group and Purvi Parekh, Co-Head of International Telecoms, Olswang</em></p>

<p><strong>Purvi</strong> on the Regulatory environment<br/>
No tailor made regulation v high regulatory focus. Regulatory focus from
leading bodies and many of them said that existing regulation can be amended
to facilitate M2M/IoT.  Made more complicated by lack of globally agreed
definition of IoT (which make it difficult for lawyers).  There's generally
promotion of Open Standards.  EU does believe that this is v important.
People should read the RAND report (Nov 2013), commissioned by the EU to
examine if there should be standards.</p>

<p><strong>Justin</strong> on IP issues<br/>
With any standardisation process, you're hoping to increase adoption with
the trade-off of Right of IPR owners.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_and_non-discriminatory_licensing">FRAND</a> (fair, reasonable, and
non-discriminatory terms) are also important but that's also debatable.
When considering how to protect IPR, it's worth comparing whole-system
claims with protecting at different layers of the tech/value stack and build
a portfolio.</p>

<h3>"The impact of autonomous systems on surface transport"</h3>

<p><em>Paul Copping, Corporate Development Director, TRL</em></p>

<p>TRL is the Transport Research Laboratory.  Did some work to consider the
impact of autonomous transport on the overall value chain.  Some of things
we're trying now with autonomous driving have been successfully done in the
past by other means (e.g car tracking a lane with magnets).</p>

<p><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/cw-iot-new-world/cw-iot-new-world-4.jpg" alt="Transport Value Chain" /></p>

<h3>"Connected Products - Designing for Scale"</h3>

<p><em>Pilgrim Beart, Founder Director, 1248-io</em></p>

<p>What is IoT?  Humans don't scale.  Population is predicted to tail off at
around 9Bn.  Connected devices are growing and the rate of change is
exponential (and increasing).  In the 90s we used to be our own sysadmin
with maybe one device.  Now we have several and some cloud services.  In the
future there will be many more and they'll have to manage themselves. There
are different problem you face as you go from 1 to 10 to 100 to 10000 to
1MM+ deployed devices.  Issues ranging from device updates al the way to
regulation and externalities that affect your business.</p>

<p>In 10 years time, when all is said and done, we won't be calling it the
Internet of Things. It'll just be called the Internet.</p>

<p>Q from an application developers perspective wht would you different earlier
in your development if you were to go back and start again<br/>
A - AlertMe started a bit too early so there were a lot things were not
off-the-shelf. Had to build. Right now can see a lot people reinventing the
wheel but shouldn't need to do this.</p>

<h3>"A new standard to connect the Internet of Everything"</h3>

<p><em>Antony Rix, Senior Consultant, TTP</em></p>

<p>One of the things TTP works on are wireless standards.</p>

<p>The size of the grey blobs are in an indication of market size.<br/>
<img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/cw-iot-new-world/cw-iot-new-world-5.jpg" alt="IoT Market Segments" /></p>

<p>Users will expect things to cost pretty much the same as they did before.
Cost will be critical and as we buy things we generally still expect them to
last for years.</p>

<p>TTP Matrix is a proprietary standard specifically for use by low-cost
wireless connected devices.  It's optimised for efficient use of radio
spectrum, long range, low cost and power efficient.  Use-case example
(DisplayData) are the pricing labels on supermarket.  50k products running
through only 3 gateways (other standards would find this difficult). Low
power consumption means a battery can last 10 years.</p>

<p><strong>Poll - Which (categories of) technical / architecture building blocks are
most urgently needed for building the Internet of Things.</strong>

<h3>Debate</h3>

<p>Interesting discussion of Humans role in IoT.  For home consumer devices
people may not want to have to make any decisions (completely automated) but
corporates my want all information in order to integrate and decide.</p>

<p>How quickly will this happen? It's difficult to say when you're in the
middle of it. We'll know it's happened after the event. It takes about a
decade for things to get things in to mature in the market. On the other
hand, it's happening.</p>

<p><strong>Poll - Big and small data - Which statement do you agree with most/least</strong>  <br/>
I only got a pic of the latter but it's the inverse of the former
(unsurprisingly).<br/>

        <h2><a class="post-title" href="/from-jekyll-to-unikernel-in-fifty-lines">From Jekyll site to Unikernel in fifty lines of code.</a></h2>
        <p><a href="http://openmirage.org">Mirage</a> has reached a point where it's possible to easily set up
end-to-end toolchains to build <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2566628">unikernels</a>! <!--\[If you're not sure what that is, read the post [What is a unikernel?][amc-unikernel]\]-->
My first use-case is to be able to generate a unikernel which can serve my
personal static site but to do it with as much automation as possible. It
turns out this is possible with less than 50 lines of code.</p>

<p>I use Jekyll and GitHub Pages at the moment so I wanted a workflow that's as
easy to use, though I'm happy to spend some time up front to set up and
configure things.
The tools for achieving what I want are in good shape so
this post takes the example of a Jekyll site (i.e this one) and goes through
the steps to produce a unikernel on
<a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> (a continuous integration service) which can later be
deployed.  Many of these instructions already exist in various forms but
they're collated here to aid this use-case.</p>

<p>I will take you, dear reader, through the process and when we're finished,
the workflow will be as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>You'll write your posts on your local machine as normal</li>
<li>A push to GitHub will trigger a unikernel build for each commit</li>
<li>The Xen unikernel will be pushed to a repo for deployment</li>
</ol>


<p>To achieve this, we'll first check that we can build a unikernel VM locally,
then we'll set up a continuous integration service to automatically build
them for us and finally we'll adapt the CI service to also deploy the built
VM.  Although the amount of code required is small, each of these steps is
covered below in some detail.
For simplicity, I'll assume you already have OCaml and Opam
installed -- if not, you can find out how via the
<a href="http://realworldocaml.org/install">Real Word OCaml install instructions</a>.</p>

<h2>Building locally</h2>

<p>To ensure that the build actually works, you should run things locally at
least once before pushing to Travis.  It's worth noting that the
<a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton">mirage-skeleton</a> repo contains a lot of useful, public domain examples
and helpfully, the specific code we need is in
<a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton/tree/master/static_website">mirage-skeleton/static_website</a>.  Copy both the <code>config.ml</code>
and <code>dispatch.ml</code> files from that folder into a new <code>_mirage</code> folder in your
jekyll repository.</p>

<p>Edit <code>config.ml</code> so that the two mentions of <code>./htdocs</code> are replaced with
<code>../_site</code>.  This is the only change you'll need to make and you should now
be able to build the unikernel with the unix backend.  Make sure you have
the mirage package installed by running <code>$ opam install mirage</code> and then run:</p>

<p><em>(edit: If you already have <code>mirage</code>, remember to <code>opam update</code> to make sure you've got the latest packages.)</em></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>_mirage
<span class="nv">$ </span>mirage configure --unix
<span class="nv">$ </span>make depend         <span class="c"># needed as of mirage 1.2 onward</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>mirage build
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ..</code></pre></div>


<p>That's all it takes!  In a few minutes there will be a unikernel built on
your system (symlinked as <code>_mirage/mir-www</code>).  If there are any errors, make
sure that Opam is up to date and that you have the latest version of the
static_website files from <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton">mirage-skeleton</a>.</p>

<h3>Serving the site locally</h3>

<p>If you'd like to see this site locally, you can do so from within the
<code>_mirage</code> folder by running unikernel you just built.  There's more
information about the details of this on the <a href="http://openmirage.org/wiki/mirage-www">Mirage docs site</a>
but the quick instructions are:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>_mirage
<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo mirage run

<span class="c"># in another terminal window</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo ifconfig tap0 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0</code></pre></div>


<p>You can now point your browser at http://10.0.0.2/ and see your site!
Once you're finished browsing, <code>$ mirage clean</code> will clear up all the
generated files.</p>

<p>Since the build is working locally, we can set up a continuous integration
system to perform the builds for us.</p>

<h2>Setting up Travis CI</h2>

<p><img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/jekyll-unikernel/travis.png"></img></p>

<p>We'll be using the <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> service, which is free for open-source
projects (so this assumes you're using a public repo).  The benefit of using
Travis is that you can build a unikernel <em>without</em> needing a local OCaml
environment, but it's always quicker to debug things locally.</p>

<p>Log in to Travis using your GitHub ID which will then trigger a scan of your
repositories.  When this is complete, go to your Travis accounts page and
find the repo you'll be building the unikernel from.  Switch it 'on' and
Travis will automatically set your GitHub post-commit hook and token for you.
That's all you need to do on the website.</p>

<p>When you next make a push to your repository, GitHub will inform Travis,
which will then look for a YAML file in the root of the repo called
<code>.travis.yml</code>.  That file describes what Travis should do and what the build
matrix is.  Since OCaml is not one of the supported languages, we'll be
writing our build script manually (this is actually easier than it sounds).
First, let's set up the YAML file and then we'll examine the build script.</p>

<h3>The Travis YAML file - .travis.yml</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/#CI-environment-OS">Travis CI environment</a> is based on Ubuntu 12.04, with a
number of things pre-installed (e.g Git, networking tools etc).  Travis
doesn't support OCaml (yet) so we'll use the <code>c</code> environment to get the
packages we need, specifically, the OCaml compiler, Opam and Mirage. Once
those are set up, our build should run pretty much the same as it did locally.</p>

<p>For now, let's keep things simple and only focus on the latest releases
(OCaml 4.01.0 and Opam 1.1.1), which means our build matrix is very simple.
The build instructions will be in the file <code>_mirage/travis.sh</code>, which we
will move to and trigger from the <code>.travis.yml</code> file.  This means our YAML
file should look like:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">language</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">c</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">before_script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">cd _mirage</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">bash -ex travis.sh</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">env</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">matrix</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">MIRAGE_BACKEND=xen DEPLOY=0</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">MIRAGE_BACKEND=unix</span></code></pre></div>


<p>The matrix enables us to have parallel builds for different environments and
this one is very simple as it's only building two unikernels. One worker
will build for the Xen backend and another worker will build for the Unix
backend. The <code>_mirage/travis.sh</code> script will clarify what each of these
environments translates to.  We'll come back to the <code>DEPLOY</code> flag later on
(it's not necessary yet).  Now that this file is set up, we can work on the
build script itself.</p>

<h3>The build script - travis.sh</h3>

<p>To save time, we'll be using an Ubuntu PPA to quickly get
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~avsm">pre-packaged versions of the OCaml compiler and Opam</a>, so the
first thing to do is define which PPAs each line of the build matrix
corresponds to.  Since we're keeping things simple, we only need one PPA
that has the most recent releases of OCaml and Opam.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>
<span class="nv">ppa</span><span class="o">=</span>avsm/ocaml41+opam11
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;yes&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:<span class="nv">$ppa</span>
sudo apt-get update -qq
sudo apt-get install -qq ocaml ocaml-native-compilers camlp4-extra opam</code></pre></div>


<p>[NB: There are many <a href="https://launchpad.net/~avsm">other PPAs</a> for different combinations of
OCaml/Opam which are useful for testing].  Once the appropriate PPAs have
been set up it's time to initialise Opam and install Mirage.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">OPAMYES</span><span class="o">=</span>1
opam init
opam install mirage
<span class="nb">eval</span> <span class="sb">`</span>opam config env<span class="sb">`</span></code></pre></div>


<p>We set <code>OPAMYES=1</code> to get non-interactive use of Opam (it defaults to 'yes'
for any user input) and if we want full build logs, we could also set
<code>OPAMVERBOSE=1</code> (I haven't in this example).
The rest should be straight-forward and you'll end up with an
Ubuntu machine with OCaml, Opam and the Mirage package installed.  It's now
trivial to do the next step of actually building the unikernel!</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mirage configure --<span class="nv">$MIRAGE_BACKEND</span>
mirage build</code></pre></div>


<p>You can see how we've used the environment variable from the Travis file and
this is where our two parallel builds begin to diverge.  When you've saved
this file, you'll need to change permissions to make it executable by doing
<code>$ chmod +x _mirage/travis.sh</code>.</p>

<p>That's all you need to build the unikernel on Travis!  You should now commit
both the YAML file and the build script to the repo and push the changes to
GitHub.  Travis should automatically start your first build and you can
watch the console output online to check that both the Xen and Unix backends
complete properly.  If you notice any errors, you should go back over your
build script and fix it before the next step.</p>

<h2>Deploying your unikernel</h2>

<p><img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px" src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/jekyll-unikernel/octocat.png"></img></p>

<p>When Travis has finished its builds it will simply destroy the worker and
all its contents, including the unikernels we just built.  This is perfectly
fine for testing but if we want to also <em>deploy</em> a unikernel, we need to get
it out of the Travis worker after it's built. In this case, we want to
extract the Xen-based unikernel so that we can later start it on a Xen-based
machine (e.g Amazon, Rackspace or - in our case - a machine on <a href="http://www.bytemark.co.uk">Bytemark</a>).</p>

<p>Since the unikernel VMs are small (only tens of MB), our method for
exporting will be to commit the Xen unikernel into a repository on GitHub.
It can be retrieved and started later on and keeping the VMs in version
control gives us very effective snapshots (we can roll back the site without
having to rebuild).  This is something that would be much more challenging
if we were using the 'standard' web toolstack.</p>

<p>The deployment step is a little more complex as we have to send the
Travis worker a private SSH key, which will give it push access to a GitHub
repository.  Of course, we don't want to expose that key by simply adding it
to the Travis file so we have to encrypt it somehow.</p>

<h3>Sending Travis a private SSH key</h3>

<p>Travis supports <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/">encrypted environment variables</a>. Each
repository has its own public key and the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/travis">Travis gem</a> uses
this public key to encrypt data, which you then add to your <code>.travis.yml</code>
file for decryption by the worker.  This is meant for sending things like
private API tokens and other small amounts of data. Trying to encrypt an SSH
key isn't going to work as it's too large.  Instead we'll use
<a href="https://github.com/avsm/travis-senv">travis-senv</a>, which encodes, encrypts and chunks up the key into smaller
pieces and then reassembles those pieces on the Travis worker.  We still use
the Travis gem to encrypt the pieces to add them to the <code>.travis.yml</code> file.</p>

<p>While you could give Travis a key that accesses your whole GitHub account, my
preference is to create a <em>new</em> deploy key, which will only be used for
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys">deployment to one repository</a>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># make a key pair on your local machine</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/.ssh/
<span class="nv">$ </span>ssh-keygen -t dsa -C <span class="s2">&quot;travis.deploy&quot;</span> -f travis-deploy_dsa
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> -</code></pre></div>


<p>Note that this is a 1024 bit key so if you decide to use a 2048 bit key,
then be aware that Travis <a href="https://github.com/avsm/travis-senv/issues/1">sometimes has issues</a>. Now that we have
a key, we can encrypt it and add it to the Travis file.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># on your local machine</span>

<span class="c"># install the necessary components</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>gem install travis
<span class="nv">$ </span>opam install travis-senv

<span class="c"># chunk the key, add to yml file and rm the intermediate</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>travis-senv encrypt ~/.ssh/travis-deploy_dsa _travis_env
<span class="nv">$ </span>cat _travis_env <span class="p">|</span> travis encrypt -ps --add
<span class="nv">$ </span>rm _travis_env</code></pre></div>


<p><code>travis-senv</code> encrypts and chunks the key locally on your machine, placing
its output in a file you decide (<code>_travis_env</code>).  We then take that output
file and pipe it to the <code>travis</code> ruby gem, asking it to encrypt the input,
treating each line as separate and to be appended (<code>-ps</code>) and then actually
adding that to the Travis file (<code>--add</code>).  You can run <code>$ travis encrypt -h</code>
to understand these options.  Once you've run the above commands,
<code>.travis.yml</code> will look as follows.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">language</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">c</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">before_script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">cd _mirage</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">bash -ex travis.sh</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">env</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>

  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">MIRAGE_BACKEND=xen DEPLOY=0</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">MIRAGE_BACKEND=unix</span>
  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">global</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">secure</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;....</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">encrypted</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">data</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">....&quot;</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">secure</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;....</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">encrypted</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">data</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">....&quot;</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">secure</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;....</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">encrypted</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">data</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">....&quot;</span>
  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">...</span></code></pre></div>


<p>The number of secure variables added depends on the type and size of the key
you had to chunk, so it could vary from 8 up to 29. We'll commit
these additions later on, alongside additions to the build script.</p>

<p>At this point, we also need to make a repository on GitHub
and add the public deploy key so
that Travis can push to it.  Once you've created your repo and added a
README, follow GitHub's instructions on <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys">adding deploy keys</a>
and paste in the public key (i.e. the content of <code>travis-deploy_dsa.pub</code>).</p>

<p>Now that we can securely pass a private SSH key to the worker
and have a repo that the worker can push to, we need to
make additions to the build script.</p>

<h3>Committing the unikernel to a repository</h3>

<p>Since we can set <code>DEPLOY=1</code> in the YAML file we only need to make
additions to the build script.  Specifically, we want to assure that: only
the Xen backend is deployed; only <em>pushes</em> to the repo result in
deployments, not pull requests (we do still want <em>builds</em> for pull requests).</p>

<p>In the build script (<code>_mirage/travis.sh</code>), which is being run by the worker,
we'll have to reconstruct the SSH key and configure Git.  In addition,
Travis gives us a set of useful <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/#Environment-variables">environment variables</a> so we'll
use the latest commit hash (<code>$TRAVIS_COMMIT</code>) to name the the VM (which also
helps us trace which commit it was built from).</p>

<p>It's easier to consider this section of code at once so I've explained the
details in the comments. This section is what you need to add at the end of
your existing build script (i.e straight after <code>mirage build</code>).</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># Only deploy if the following conditions are met.</span>

<p>At this point you should commit the changes to <code>./travis.yml</code> (don't forget
the deploy flag) and <code>_mirage/travis.sh</code> and push the changes to GitHub.
Everything else will take place automatically and in a few minutes you will
have a unikernel ready to deploy on top of Xen!</p>

<p>You can see both the complete YAML file and build script in use on my
<a href="https://github.com/amirmc/www-test">test repo</a>, as well as the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/amirmc/www-test">build logs</a> for that repo
and the <a href="https://github.com/amirmc/www-test-deploy">deploy repo</a> with a VM.</p>

<p><em>[Pro-tip: If you add </em><code>[skip ci]</code><em> anywhere in your
commit message, Travis will skip the build for that commit.
This is very useful if you're making minor changes, like updating a
README.]</em></p>

<h2>Finishing up</h2>

<p>Since I'm still using Jekyll for my website, I made a short script in my
jekyll repository (<code>_deploy-unikernel.sh</code>) that builds the site, commits the
contents of <code>_site</code> and pushes to GitHub. I simply run this after I've
committed a new blog post and the rest takes care of itself.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

git add _site
git commit -m <span class="s1">&#39;update _site&#39;</span>

<p>Congratulations! You now have an end-to-end workflow that will produce a
unikernel VM from your Jekyll-based site and push it to a repo.  If you
strip out all the comments, you'll see that we've written less than 50 lines
of code! Admittedly, I'm not counting the 80 or so lines that came for free
in the <code>*.ml</code> files but that's still pretty impressive.</p>

<p>Of course, we still need a machine to take that VM and run it but that's a
topic for another post.  For the time-being, I'm still using GitHub Pages
but once the VM is hosted somewhere, I will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Turn off GitHub Pages and serve from the VM -- but still using Jekyll in
the workflow.</li>
<li>Replace Jekyll with OCaml-based static-site generation.</li>
</ol>


<p>Although all the tools already exist to switch now, I'm taking my time so
that I can easily maintain the code I end up using.</p>

<h2>Expanding the script for testing</h2>

<p>You may have noticed that the examples here are not very flexible or
extensible but that was a deliberate choice to keep them readable.  It's
possible to do much more with the build matrix and script, as you can see
from the Travis files on my <a href="https://github.com/amirmc/amirmc.github.com/tree/master/_mirage">website repo</a>, which were based on
those of the <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www">Mirage site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mor1/mort-www">Mort's site</a>.
Specifically, you can note the use of more environment variables and case
statements to decide which PPAs to grab.  Once you've got your builds
working, it's worth improving your scripts to make them more maintainable
and cover the test cases you feel are important.</p>

<h3>Not just for static sites (surprise!)</h3>

<p>You might have noticed that in very few places in the toolchain above have I
mentioned anything specific to static sites per se.  The workflow is simply
(1) do some stuff locally, (2) push to a continuous integration service
which then (3) builds and deploys a Xen-based unikernel.  Apart from the
convenient folder structure, the specific work to treat this as a static
site lives in the <code>*.ml</code> files, which I've skipped over for this post.</p>

<p>As such, the GitHub+Travis workflow we've developed here is quite general
and will apply to almost <em>any</em> unikernels that we may want to construct.
I encourage you to explore the examples in the <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton">mirage-skeleton</a> repo and
keep your build script maintainable.  We'll be using it again the next time
we build unikernel devices.</p>

        <p>This is an update to an <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/scientific-evidence-for-health-supplements/">earlier version</a> of this infographic, which I
came across two years ago.  It was interesting at the time since it did a
good job at displaying the myriad supplements in a way that indicated both
their likely efficacy, according to research papers, and how popular the
search term was.  For example, the previous image showed 'strong' evidence
for licorice root as an aid for coughs, but it had a much smaller search
volume than the equivalently effective fish-oil for blood pressure.  I also
really liked the concept of the 'Worth it Line'.</p>

<p>The graphic has been updated a couple of times now, with the most recent
change a few weeks ago.  There are quite a few differences as garlic didn't
feature so prominently on the previous image and it looks like a number of
things may have been removed (e.g licorice root).</p>

<p>Vitamin D, as beneficial to general health, is still way up there.  I
decided to try Vitamin D3 supplements over the winter, under the theory that
I'm not getting enough sun so a supplement may be useful.  I was quite
surprised at how much better I felt after a day or so of taking it, to the
point where I tried looking up work on Vitamin D and mood*.  Scanning the
research seemed to indicate that there may be links between Vitamin D,
serotonin levels and depression but the extent isn't clear and conclusions
were mixed.  Of course, that mostly supports what the infographic is saying
and it puts it above the 'Worth it Line' (for depression specifically but
not general 'mood' per se).</p>

<p>I encourage you to go visit the site as there's an
<a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/play/snake-oil-supplements/">interactive version</a>, where you can highlight a bubble to get more
info and be transported to the main study it references.  If you like, you

        <h2><a class="post-title" href="/switching-from-bootstrap-to-zurb-foundation">Switching from Bootstrap to Zurb Foundation</a></h2>
        <p>I've just updated my site's HTML/CSS and moved from Twitter Bootstrap to
<a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/features.html">Zurb Foundation</a>.  This post captures my subjective notes on the
migration.</p>

<h4>My use of Bootstrap</h4>

<p>When I originally set this site up, I didn't know what frameworks existed or
anything more than the basics of dealing with HTML (and barely any CSS).  I
came across Twitter Bootstrap and immediately decided it would Solve All My
Problems.  It really did.  Since then, I've gone through one 'upgrade' with
Bootstrap (from 1.x to 2.x), after which I dutifully ignored all the fixes
and improvements (note that Bootstrap was up to v2.3.2 while I was still
using v2.0.2).</p>

<p><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/switch-to-foundation/responsive-design.png" alt="Responsive Design" /></p>

<p>For the most part, this was fine with me but for a while now, I've been
meaning to make this site 'responsive' (read: not look like crap from a
mobile).  Bootstrap v3 purports to be mobile-first so upgrading would likely
give me what I'm after but v3 is <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/">not backwards compatible</a>,
meaning I'd have to rewrite parts of the HTML.  Since this step was
unavoidable, it led me to have another look at front-end frameworks, just to
see if I was missing anything.  This was especially relevant since we'd
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/announcing-new-ocamlorg/">just released</a> the new <a href="http://ocaml.org">OCaml.org</a>
website, itself built with Bootstrap v2.3.1 (we'd done the design/templating
work long before v3 was released).  It would be useful to know what else is
out there for any future work.</p>

<p>Around this time I discovered Zurb Foundation and also the numerous
comparisons between them (note: Foundation seems to come out ahead in most
of those).  A few days ago, the folks at Zurb released
<a href="http://zurb.com/article/1280/foundation-5-blasts-off--2">version 5</a>, so I decided that now is the time to kick the
tires.  For the last few days, I've been playing with the framework and in
the end I decided to migrate my site over completely.</p>

<p><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/features.html"><img src="http://amirchaudhry.com/images/switch-to-foundation/zurb-yeti.png" alt="Foundation's Yeti" /></a></p>

<h4>Swapping out one framework for another</h4>

<p>Over time, I've become moderately experienced with HTML/CSS and I can
usually wrangle things to look the way I want, but my solutions aren't
necessarily elegant. I was initially concerned that I'd already munged
things so much that changing anything would be a pain.  When I first put the
styles for this site together, I had to spend quite a bit of time
overwriting Bootstrap's defaults so I was prepared for the same when using
Foundation.  Turns out that I was fine.  I currently use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> (and
<a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com">Jekyll Bootstrap</a>) so I only had three template files and a couple of
HTML pages to edit and because I'd kept most of my custom CSS in a separate
file, it was literally a case of swapping out one framework for another and
bug-fixing from there onwards.  There's definitely a lesson here in using
automation as much as possible.</p>

<p>Customising the styles was another area of concern but I was pleasantly
surprised to find I needed <em>less</em> customisation than with Bootstrap.  This
is likely because I didn't have to override as many defaults (and probably
because I've learned more about CSS since then).  The one thing I seemed to
be missing was a way to deal with code sections, so I just took what
Bootstrap had and copied it in.  At some point I should revisit this.</p>

<p>It did take me a while to get my head around Foundation's grid but it was
worth it in the end.  The idea is that you should design for small screens
first and then adjust things for larger screens as necessary. There are
several different default sizes which inherit their properties from the size
below, unless you explicitly override them.  I initially screwed this up by
explicitly defining the grid using the <code>small-#</code> classes, which obviously
looks ridiculous on small screens.  I fixed it by swapping out <code>small-#</code> for
<code>medium-#</code> everywhere in the HTML, after which everything looked reasonable.
Items flowed sensibly into a default column for the small screens and looked
acceptable for larger screens and perfectly fine on desktops.  I could do
more styling of the mobile view but I'd already achieved most of what I was
after.</p>

<h4>Fixing image galleries and embedded content</h4>

<p>The only additional thing I used from Bootstrap was the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel">Carousel</a>. I'd
written some custom helper scripts that would take some images and
thumbnails from a specified folder and produce clickable thumbnails with a
slider underneath.  Foundation provides <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/orbit.html">Orbit</a>, so I had to spend time
rewriting my script to produce the necessary HTML.  This actually resulted
in cleaner HTML and one of the features I wanted (the ability to link to a
specific image) was available by default in Orbit.  At this point I also
tried to make the output look better for the case where JavaScript is
disabled (in essence, each image is just displayed as a list).  Below is an
example of an image gallery, taken from a previous post, when I
<a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/joined-the-computer-lab/">joined the computer lab</a>.</p>

<div class="gallery">
  <noscript><small><em>Note: The gallery needs JavaScript but I've tried to make it degrade gracefully. -Amir</em></small></noscript>
  <ul class="inline-list">
    
      <li><a data-orbit-link="join-comp-lab-1"><img src="/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-thumb-1.png" alt="join-comp-lab-thumb-1" /></a></li>
    
      <li><a data-orbit-link="join-comp-lab-2"><img src="/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-thumb-2.png" alt="join-comp-lab-thumb-2" /></a></li>
    
      <li><a data-orbit-link="join-comp-lab-3"><img src="/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-thumb-3.png" alt="join-comp-lab-thumb-3" /></a></li>
    
  </ul>
  <ul data-orbit data-options="next_on_click:true; timer_speed:3000; pause_on_hover:false; bullets:false;">
    
    <li class="gallery-image" data-orbit-slide="join-comp-lab-1"><img src="/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-1.jpg" alt="join-comp-lab-1"></li>
    
    <li class="gallery-image" data-orbit-slide="join-comp-lab-2"><img src="/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-2.jpg" alt="join-comp-lab-2"></li>
    
    <li class="gallery-image" data-orbit-slide="join-comp-lab-3"><img src="/images/join-comp-lab/join-comp-lab-3.jpg" alt="join-comp-lab-3"></li>
    
  </ul>
</div>


<p>Foundation also provides a component called <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/flex_video.html">Flex Video</a>, which allows the
browser to scale videos to the appropriate size.  This fix was as simple as
going back through old posts and wrapping anything that was <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> in a
<code>&lt;div class="flex-video"&gt;</code>.  It really was that simple and all the Vimeo and
YouTube items scaled perfectly.  Here's an example of a video from an
earlier post, where I gave a <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/">walkthrough of the ocaml.org site</a>.
Try changing the width of your browser window to see it scale.</p>

<div class="flex-video widescreen vimeo">
  <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/61768157?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=de9e6a" width="540" height="303" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowFullScreen="true">Video demo</iframe>
</div>


<h4>Framework differences</h4>

<p>Another of the main difference between the two frameworks is that Bootstrap
uses <a href="http://lesscss.org">LESS</a> to manage its CSS whereas Foundation uses <a href="http://sass-lang.com">SASS</a>.  Frankly,
I've no experience with either of them so it makes little difference to me.
It's worth bearing in mind for anyone who's workflow does involve
pre-processing.  Also, Bootstrap is available under the
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#license-faqs">Apache 2 License</a>, while Foundation is released under
the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/faq.html#question-3">MIT license</a>.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Overall, the transition was pretty painless and most of the time was spent
getting familiar with the grid, hunting for docs/examples and trying to make
the image gallery work the way I wanted.  I do think Bootstrap's docs are
better but Foundation's aren't bad.</p>

<p>Although this isn't meant to be a comparison, I much prefer Foundation to
Bootstrap.  If you're not sure which to use then I think the secret is in
the names of the frameworks.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bootstrap (for me) was a <em>great</em> way to '<em>bootstrap</em>' a site quickly with
lots of acceptable defaults -- it was quick to get started but took some
work to alter.</li>
<li>Foundation seems to provide a great '<em>foundation</em>' on which to create more
customised sites -- it's more flexible but needs more upfront thought.</li>
</ul>


<p>That's pretty much how I'd recommend them to people now.</p>
